<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'><i>Chapter One</i></p>

<p>Janet Hardy stirred sleepily as the alarm clock sounded its lusty summons and
it was only after a real effort that she managed to reach out and shut off the
insistent clock.</p>

<p>It was so early that shadows of the night still lurked in the corners and
Janet squinted at the clock through sleep-clogged eyes. It was four-forty
a.m.</p>

<p>Sitting up in bed she looked across the room where Helen Thorne was deep in
sleep, oblivious to the strident summons of the alarm which had echoed through
their bedroom.</p>

<p>Janet, now thoroughly awake, tossed her pillow at the slumbering Helen. She
scored a perfect hit and Helen, sputtering and wondering what it was all about,
popped up in bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, sleepy head. It&#8217;s time to be up and dressing if we&#8217;re
going to get to the studio in time for that six o&#8217;clock call,&#8221; warned
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll beat you to the shower,&#8221; promised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>Helen. She jumped
out of bed and grabbed the dressing gown on a nearby chair. There was a rush of
feet padding down the hall and Helen made good her promise, reaching the shower
room two jumps ahead of Janet.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, after brisk showers and thorough towelings, they were
dressed. From the kitchen had come waftings of delicious bacon and eggs and they
knew that George, the colored cook, was getting breakfast.</p>

<p>When they reached the dining room they were surprised to find Helen&#8217;s
father there, a morning paper propped in front of him.</p>

<p>Henry Thorne, world famous as the star director of motion pictures for the
Ace Motion Picture Corp., looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;An early call?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy Fenstow is starting to shoot his new western, &#8216;Water
Hole,&#8217; and we don&#8217;t want to be late the first morning,&#8221; explained
Helen, slipping into her chair while Janet sat down opposite her. George,
smiling a greeting, brought in a large platter of bacon and eggs. Then there
were tall glasses of cold milk and thin, deliciously buttered toast. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>&#8220;I
didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be up so early, Dad,&#8221; said Helen, between mouthfuls
of bacon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I went to bed too early,&#8221; smiled her father. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been awake an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were all tired out after finishing &#8216;Kings of the
Air,&#8217;&#8221; went on Helen and her father nodded his agreement.</p>

<p>Janet, on the other side of the table, said nothing, but thought a great
deal. She had never quite gotten over the thrill of coming to Hollywood and the
manner in which it had been accomplished. It seemed too much like a dream and at
times she went around pinching herself to make sure she wasn&#8217;t asleep.</p>

<p>Classmates back in the medium-sized city of Clarion in the middle west, Janet
and Helen had been fast friends and their families had been neighbors for years.
Then Henry Thorne had made a success as a director of motion pictures, but Helen
and Mrs. Thorne had remained in the family home in Clarion. Back for Helen&#8217;s
graduation, he had been impressed by the acting ability of Janet and Helen, as
well as their charm, and their graduation presents had been round trip airplane
tickets from Clarion to Hollywood. Mrs. Thorne had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>along to chaperon
the party and they had taken a comfortable, rambling bungalow on a side street
in Hollywood where they could be assured of privacy.</p>

<p>Janet could recall so vividly their first day. Pictures, interviews,
attendance at a premiere in gowns designed by the famous designer who created
all of the gowns for the stars of the Ace company. Then a chance to work in a
western in the production unit headed by rotund little Billy Fenstow and after
that small parts in &#8220;Kings of the Air,&#8221; which Henry Thorne had
directed as one of the outstanding pictures on his company&#8217;s production
program.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you mooning about?&#8221; asked Helen, for Janet, her mind
running back over the events of the last crowded weeks, had ceased
eating.</p>

<p>Janet flushed. &#8220;Just thinking of all the wonderful things that have
happened since we graduated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t remember the unpleasant ones you experienced while
we were making &#8216;Kings of the Air,&#8217;&#8221; said Helen&#8217;s father. He
was well-built, with a touch of grey hair at his temples and a smile that
inspired confidence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>and an almost
instant feeling of friendliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was pretty scared at the time,&#8221; confessed Janet, &#8220;but
now that the picture&#8217;s safely completed, it&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about &#8216;Kings&#8217;?&#8221; Helen asked her
father.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and Janet thought she saw a touch of weariness in
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;It should be a good
picture, but whether it will be a great picture is something else again. We can
only wait until it&#8217;s out of the cutting room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet, although in a comparatively minor rôle, had been a key figure in the
making of &#8220;Kings of the Air,&#8221; for a rival company, attempting to
hinder the progress of the picture, had hired an actress in the company, blonde
Bertie Jackson, and two renegade airmen, to make every effort to slow up
production. Janet had been kidnaped and held prisoner overnight while the ghost
town, where the company was located, was burned and a big set on the desert
bombed. But the resourcefulness of Curt Newsom, cowboy star who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>a rôle in the
picture, had helped expose the sabotage and Janet had been speedily released. As
a result she had been promoted to Bertie Jackson&#8217;s rôle and had handled it
like a veteran trouper.</p>

<p>Just then George, the cook, looked in to see if more bacon and eggs were
needed, and Helen&#8217;s mother, in a dressing gown, joined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone should have called me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t have to report on the lot and we do,&#8221; Helen
reminded her mother.</p>

<p>It was 5:30 o&#8217;clock when they finished breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drive you over to the lot,&#8221; said Henry Thorne.
&#8220;Mother, you dress while I&#8217;m away and we&#8217;ll take a long drive into the
mountains and stop someplace for lunch. We&#8217;ll sort of have a day&#8217;s vacation
for ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they were away, speeding toward the studio in an open car. It was a
glorious morning and the cool air was invigorating. Later in the day it would be
uncomfortably hot.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow, director of western pictures, was on stage nine, well to the
back of the Ace lot. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>There were few
around the rambling studio at that hour, for production was past its peak and
only two or three of the huge sound stages would be in use that day.</p>

<p>The director, who had only a fringe of hair around his shining pate, greeted
them cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you read over the script of &#8216;Water Hole&#8217;?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>Janet nodded. &#8220;I like it better than &#8216;Broad Valley,&#8217;&#8221;
she smiled.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow fairly beamed. &#8220;Good. I wrote it myself. The other was
only partly mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen laughed and turned to Janet. &#8220;What are you trying to do,
compliment Mr. Fenstow so he&#8217;ll give you the leading rôle?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the director&#8217;s turn to chuckle. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t have to,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Janet is playing opposite Curt Newsom in the lead right
now.&#8221; </p>

</div>

<div>
<a id='ref_ab'></a>
<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top: 64px;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span><i>Chapter Two</i></p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>SHOOTING ON LOCATION</p>

<p>Janet stared hard at the chubby director. It was hard to believe that Billy
Fenstow would joke with her now. That would be too cruel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe me, Janet?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be possible,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m an
unknown. You wouldn&#8217;t put me into the leading rôle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Curt Newsom, the western star arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the new leading lady?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#x2014;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; gasped Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure.
Everything seems to be in kind of a whirl. I guess I&#8217;ll sit
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet dropped into a nearby chair, oblivious of the fact that it was the
cherished property of the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s grand, Janet, simply grand,&#8221; exclaimed Helen. &#8220;My,
but I&#8217;m proud of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow came over to Janet. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>&#8220;You
needn&#8217;t be so surprised,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only don&#8217;t let this go to your head. It doesn&#8217;t take a whole lot
of acting ability to be a leading lady in a western. All you&#8217;ve got to have is
a fair amount of beauty, some brains, and the ability to keep on top of a
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet, recalling her experiences in &#8220;Broad Valley,&#8221; the first
picture they had appeared in, smiled a little ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;ll even be able to stay on a horse,&#8221;
she admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll glue you into the saddle,&#8221; smiled the
director.</p>

<p>Others in the company came up. Most of them had been in the earlier picture
and without exception they congratulated Janet on winning the leading
rôle.</p>

<p>The weather was ideal and Billy Fenstow intended to make the most of it by
shooting all of the exteriors possible.</p>

<p>Promptly at seven o&#8217;clock a large bus rolled onto the lot and the entire
company, numbering some thirty-three, including the technicians, boarded the big
vehicle.</p>

<p>Their destination was a ranch well into the foothills and it was after noon
before they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>arrived. This
particular outfit had never before been used for film purposes for it was well
away from the usual run of traffic and harder to reach than some of the layouts
nearer the studio.</p>

<p>The ranchhouse was large and comfortable and arrangements were made for all
of the girls in the company to stay there while the men would be quartered in
the bunkhouse with the exception of the director, who planned to drive back and
forth from the nearest town.</p>

<p>A truck loaded with camera and sound equipment had preceded the bus and the
technicians went to work to assemble their materials. The pole corral was
crowded with horses and the assistant director, &#8220;Skeets&#8221; Irwin, took
over the task of assigning horses to the various members of the company.</p>

<p>Curt Newsom had his own string, which had been brought by truck, but the
others were to ride ranch horses. Janet drew a beautiful sorrel while Helen was
mounted on a black with only one white foot.</p>

<p>There was a gorgeous sunset and Billy Fenstow, always on the alert for a good
background shot, had his cameras catch some typical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>ranch scenes. They
might not fit in with the present picture but he knew some day the footage would
come in handy.</p>

<p>After dinner in the ranchhouse that night, Janet and Helen retired to the
room they shared and studied the scripts which had been handed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Water Hole&#8221; was a typical Billy Fenstow western with lots of
hard riding and plenty of scenery. It was the story of Curt Newsom&#8217;s defense
of his small ranch with its valuable water hole against a larger cattle
outfit.</p>

<p>Janet played the rôle of a school teacher while Helen was a waitress in the
one restaurant in the little cow town to which the cowboys migrated every
Saturday night. The girls were to have an important part in solving the plot to
get Curt&#8217;s ranch and all in all they were greatly pleased with their
parts.</p>

<p>Janet sat down and wrote a long letter home, telling of their good fortune
and of her own in particular. She paused a moment and closed her eyes. Perhaps
her mother would show the letter to Pete Benda, the city editor of the
<i>Clarion Times</i>. And Pete, of course, would make a story. Perhaps he would
put <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>it in the
front page under a heading, &#8220;Clarion Girl Gets Leading Rôle in Western
Picture.&#8221; She smiled a little. That would be rather nice.</p>

<p>Then she awoke from her reverie and finished the letter. After that it was
bedtime for there was an early call.</p>

<p>They were out the next morning shortly after dawn for Billy Fenstow worked
his companies long and hard.</p>

<p>Janet was in several shots that day riding to and from the ranch to the
schoolhouse and in the afternoon they went to the schoolhouse where a dozen
youngsters had been gathered. Most of them were actual pupils of the little
school and the cameras ground away as Janet dismissed them from a make-believe
class and watched them hurry away from school toward their homes, some of them
afoot and others on sturdy little cow ponies.</p>

<p>Helen had little to do that day, but followed every action of the company
with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of it?&#8221; she asked Janet that night as they
lounged on the broad verandah of the ranchhouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like it a lot,&#8221; said Janet whole-heartedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>&#8220;Of course I
realize I&#8217;m no actress, but the picture&#8217;s good and clean and it&#8217;s a
consolation to be in something like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was silent for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about our future in the movies?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>Janet pondered the question before answering, for she, too, had been
wondering that very thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want to know the truth, I think we&#8217;re just about where we
belong. I know I&#8217;m not a real actress. I can get by in a picture like this or
in some minor rôle, but I&#8217;d never make a really top-notch actress and it
would be rather heart-breaking to stay here and do this year in and year
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that means you&#8217;ll go back to Clarion when summer&#8217;s
over?&#8221; Helen asked the question with a touch of desperate anxiety in her
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; replied Janet slowly, &#8220;for I know that I
won&#8217;t be especially happy here. It&#8217;s been glorious fun and it still is, but
it can&#8217;t last forever and I&#8217;m not fooling myself about that for a
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent for a time, wondering if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>the coming fall
would bring an end to their close companionship. If Janet went back to Clarion,
it would be only logical that Helen would stay on in Hollywood with her father
and mother. The thought of parting was not a pleasant prospect to either
girl.</p>

<p>They went to bed later without discussing the matter further, but as the
shooting of &#8220;Water Hole&#8221; progressed and August drew to a close, it
was constantly in their minds.</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s father and mother came out to visit them on location several times,
but neither one of them mentioned any plans for Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two more days of work and we&#8217;ll have the picture in the can,&#8221;
Billy Fenstow told the company one morning. &#8220;We&#8217;re right on schedule and
I want to finish that way, but we&#8217;ve got some hard riding scenes to get out of
the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The director turned to Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to shoot that scene of your ride from town to the ranch to
warn Curt that his enemies are riding to wipe out his ranch,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet nodded and swung into the saddle of the rangy sorrel. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>Billy Fenstow
climbed onto the light truck which carried the cameras and Janet&#8217;s horse
trotted along behind as the vehicle rolled away across the valley in which the
ranch was located. They went for perhaps two miles through the hills to a hamlet
along a branch line railroad which had served as the cow town for the
picture&#8217;s locale. It was here that Janet began her ride, but before she
started she looked to the cinches.</p>

<p>She remounted and sat easily in the saddle, waiting for the signal to
start.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow waved his hand and the truck started swiftly away, Janet riding
hard after it. She rode with a natural lithesomeness of her body. The light felt
hat which had been crushed over her brown hair came off. She clutched at it
instinctively, but missed, and kept on riding, her golden hair streaming away
from her shoulders. Janet smiled to herself. At least that would give a
realistic effect.</p>

<p>She watched the director covertly and when he motioned again she sent the
sorrel racing away from the camera truck at an angle so the cameras could get a
side shot. Then the truck moved ahead of her. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>It was hot and
dry, and anything but an easy task to ride a horse pounding along as hard as the
big sorrel. Finally they topped the last hill and swept down into the valley and
Janet braced herself for the last bit of action.</p>

<p>Curt, near the water hole, looked up when he heard the pounding hoofs and
Janet hurled herself from the saddle and ran to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Curt, they&#8217;re riding hard behind me. You&#8217;ve got to get out
of here. I&#8217;ll stay and watch the ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Curt refused and the action was cut there.</p>

<p>Janet was dusty and sweaty and she walked to the pump and drank deeply of the
cool, sweet water.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can imagine there might have been a fight over this ranch in the
early days,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was,&#8221; grinned Curt, &#8220;but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as big a
one as we&#8217;re putting into the picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet&#8217;s hardest scene for the day was over and Helen was in only one or two
minor shots so they passed part of the afternoon packing up their things in
preparation for the departure the next afternoon. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>It was nearly
dinner time when a dust covered car rolled into the valley and approached the
ranchhouse.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen, sitting on the front steps, watched it with interest which
deepened as they saw an Iowa license plate on the front of the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;That almost looks like home,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;Why, the
number&#8217;s from our home county. Maybe it&#8217;s someone we know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the sun was flashing off the windshield, effectively shielding the
passengers in the car.</p>

<p>The machine swung to a stop a few feet away and Janet and Helen, when they
saw the passengers, recognized them with mixed emotions. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>SURPRISE CALLERS</p>

<p>The newcomers were Cora Dean and Margie Blake, classmates from Clarion, who
had been Janet and Helen&#8217;s chief rivals for almost every honor during their
last four years in school.</p>

<p>&#8220;What under the sun do you suppose they want here?&#8221; asked Helen
under her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon find out,&#8221; retorted Janet, rising and advancing to
greet Cora and Margie.</p>

<p>Cora was dark like Helen, while Margie&#8217;s hair was almost as golden blonde
as Janet&#8217;s, the difference being that Margie used drug store coloring, and
Janet depended on the natural shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello Cora, hello Margie. This is a surprise,&#8221; said Janet as she
greeted them and Helen echoed the sentiment a minute later.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been touring through the west. When we learned a company was
shooting a picture out here we came on over. We didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>know until we
stopped in the village that it was the company you&#8217;re with.&#8221; It was
Cora, her tongue as sharp as ever, making the explanation.</p>

<p>Margie was taking in everything and fairly gaping at the cowboys who in their
picturesque garb, were lounging nearby waiting for the gong to call them to
supper.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow came by and Janet called to him, introducing Cora and
Margie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have them stay for dinner and meet the company,&#8221; said the
director, who, with the film on schedule, felt particularly hospitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;d love that,&#8221; gurgled Cora. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always
wanted to see a picture being taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow scratched his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re all through for today, but if Janet and Helen could bunk
double and give you one of the beds in their room, you could stay over and see
the final shooting tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that would be grand,&#8221; put in Margie, &#8220;and I&#8217;m sure
Janet and Helen won&#8217;t mind doubling up.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was little Janet or Helen could say, except to agree, and they helped
Cora and Margie get their bags out of the car and escorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>them up to the
room which they occupied.</p>

<p>At dinner that night they introduced the girls to all of the members of the
company who ate at the ranchhouse and Janet noted that Cora could hardly keep
her eyes off tall, handsome Curt Newsom. Curt was nice to them, as he was to
everybody, explaining carefully all of the questions they asked.</p>

<p>That night Cora asked a question that had kept her on edge all
evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose we could get in one of the scenes tomorrow?&#8221; she
asked Janet. &#8220;Surely you or Helen could get the director to use us just a
little bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet was dubious. It was the last day at the ranch and there would be much
to be done. Billy Fenstow would be in no mood for trifles such as working
friends into scenes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t the last day I think it could be arranged,&#8221; put
in Helen, &#8220;but I&#8217;d hate to ask Mr. Fenstow to do it under the
circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margie pouted visibly and Cora, always arrogant, flared up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course you won&#8217;t. Just because your father&#8217;s a director and
they have to put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>you in pictures
you won&#8217;t say a good word for anyone else. How do we know you&#8217;re even in
this company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to take our word for it until you see the picture on the
screen,&#8221; retorted Helen.</p>

<p>Janet could understand the tremendous desire of Cora and Margie to appear in
a scene. It was the most natural thing in the world and she felt just a little
sorry for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to Mr. Fenstow in the morning,&#8221; she promised.
&#8220;If he&#8217;s in a good mood he may find a spot for you, but if he&#8217;s
grouchy he&#8217;ll probably order you away from the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know when he&#8217;s grouchy?&#8221; asked Margie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t until after you&#8217;ve asked him,&#8221; replied Janet, with
a thin smile.</p>

<p>Cora and Margie exhibited a tremendous curiosity, asking questions about
everything and from almost everyone, Cora especially plaguing Curt Newsom, until
the tall cowboy star finally found an excuse to escape from her constant
barrage.</p>

<p>It was late when they went to bed and Janet and Helen, sleeping in a narrow,
single bed, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>did
not rest well. They were awake at dawn, both of them feeling tired and
worn.</p>

<p>Cora and Margie, imbued with the excitement of actually being with a movie
company, appeared as vivacious as ever.</p>

<p>At breakfast Billy Fenstow outlined plans for the final day&#8217;s
shooting.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got one more scene to take in the village,&#8221; he
explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shot of a group of townspeople watching the arrival
of Curt and the rustlers he has captured.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impetuous Cora Dean broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;May Margie and I get in the crowd scene?&#8221; she asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>A frown appeared on Billy Fenstow&#8217;s usually bland face, for he disliked
greatly being interrupted when he was outlining his plans to his company.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about it later,&#8221; he said curtly, and continued with
his explanation.</p>

<p>After breakfast Cora faced Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad you couldn&#8217;t have said a good word for us with your
director,&#8221; she flared.</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a real good chance,&#8221; replied Janet. &#8220;I
warned you last night not to bother him if he wasn&#8217;t in a good mood.&#8221;
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>&#8220;But how
was I to know?&#8221; complained Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you do now,&#8221; said Janet, and it was hard to keep from
smiling. But she could realize how much it would mean to Cora and Margie and it
would be mean of her not to help them just a little so later she spoke to
&#8220;Skeets&#8221; Irwin, the assistant director, and &#8220;Skeets&#8221;
promised to get Cora and Margie into the crowd scene.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen were in the same scene and they changed into their costumes,
Janet into a dusty riding habit and Helen into a gingham dress and the apron
that was her badge as a waitress in the village&#8217;s one restaurant.</p>

<p>The girls rode down to the village, Cora and Margie following in their own
car. &#8220;Skeets&#8221; had provided them with appropriate costumes and they
were so excited they could hardly talk.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow was back giving instructions to the riders who were to sweep
down into the village while &#8220;Skeets&#8221; handled the scene at the
village.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand around like a bunch of wooden Indians,&#8221; said the
assistant director. &#8220;Show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>some interest when
those horsemen come over the hills. I want plenty of action in this
scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep close to us,&#8221; Janet advised Cora and Margie. &#8220;All you
have to do is look excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be easy,&#8221; smiled Margie. &#8220;I&#8217;m so
nervous now I can&#8217;t stay still a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Final instructions were given and the cameras started grinding as a massed
body of riders swept over the crest of the hills and galloped madly toward the
village.</p>

<p>The girls, who had been in the restaurant, rushed into the street and joined
the other members of the company and the villagers who had been pressed into
service as extras.</p>

<p>It was action and good action. Janet thrilled at the magnificent riding of
Curt Newsom, who rode with consumate skill and grace. He was a part of the horse
he was astride and it was no effort to Janet to register extreme
excitement.</p>

<p>The mounted men, a band of captives in the center of the group, reined in
before the astonished villagers and Curt, dismounting, pulled one of the
captives from his saddle and strode toward the door which was marked sheriff&#8217;s
office. Curt pulled the protesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>rider after him,
disappearing into the sheriff&#8217;s office. That finished the sequence and the
cameras stopped clicking.</p>

<p>It was the last of the big scenes and the rest of the day was to be spent in
picking up shots to fill out the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose we looked all right?&#8221; asked Cora, who had been
fitted out in a housedress and sunbonnet. Margie was similarly attired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you looked your parts,&#8221; Janet assured them,
&#8220;but don&#8217;t be too disappointed when you see the picture. There&#8217;ll only
be a flash of this action on the screen and the &#8216;mob&#8217; scene won&#8217;t
last more than a few seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see that one of the theaters at home books it,&#8221; declared
Margie firmly, &#8220;and maybe Pete Benda will run a story about
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he did,&#8221; agreed Janet.</p>

<p>They went back to the ranchhouse for lunch and Billy Fenstow beamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ahead of schedule now. Another two hours and we&#8217;ll be ready
to start for the studio where we can finish up the interiors in a couple more
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bus which had brought them from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>Hollywood rolled
into the valley and several of the cowboys started loading baggage and equipment
aboard it.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen went upstairs, followed by Cora and Margie. Both of the
latter had been hinting that they would like an invitation to stay for a time in
Hollywood, but they had been so mean and small during their high school days
that neither Janet nor Helen could bear the thought of entertaining them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming back to Clarion this fall?&#8221; asked Cora, her dark eyes
fairly snapping as she waited eagerly for the answer to her question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea,&#8221; replied Janet, quite
truthfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Helen?&#8221; It was Margie asking this time.</p>

<p>Helen shook her head. &#8220;Your guess is as good as mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you stay on in pictures?&#8221; asked Cora, a tinge of sarcasm
in her voice.</p>

<p>That nettled Janet. &#8220;If we want to,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;but
neither one of us can see much of a future in being actresses in western
films.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all of the influence your father has, you ought to be able to get
into better pictures,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>Margie told Helen,
and it was her turn to feel a mounting flood of color in her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can leave Dad out of this. He gave us an introduction, but we&#8217;ve
won our parts,&#8221; snapped Helen.</p>

<p>The girls finished packing in silence and were ready to go down stairs when
&#8220;Skeets&#8221; stuck his head in the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bus is all ready to start back for the city,&#8221; he said, picking
up Janet&#8217;s and Helen&#8217;s bags.</p>

<p>Cora and Margie took their own luggage and followed them down stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we ought to invite them to Hollywood with us?&#8221;
whispered Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; replied Janet, &#8220;for they would have
to be entertained in your home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you honestly think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet didn&#8217;t answer at once, but as they reached the bus, she said,
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve had about all of the insinuations I can stand from either
one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s a help, for I feel the same way.&#8221; She
turned toward the other girls, who were putting their baggage in their
car.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may see you in Clarion before college starts this fall,&#8221; she
said. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>&#8220;Thanks
for all your help,&#8221; flipped Cora, seating herself behind the wheel.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll enjoy ourselves in Hollywood. We may run into you
someplace.&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw in the gears and the car lurched away along the dusty road that
wound through the hills to the main highway some miles away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t she nice and cordial?&#8221; smiled Helen as she turned back
to Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora hasn&#8217;t changed a bit and I don&#8217;t suppose she will. What fun
she could have if she&#8217;d only be a little less selfish,&#8221; said Janet.
</p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>HIGH PRAISE</p>

<p>By the time everything was loaded into the bus, the sun was well down toward
the western hills and the ranch was bathed in the soft, warm light of the late
afternoon.</p>

<p>Curt Newsom, who had finished superintending the loading of his own horses
into his private truck, walked over to join the girls, his spurs jingling as he
walked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad it&#8217;s all over?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Janet shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly. I&#8217;ve enjoyed it so much I really didn&#8217;t want it to end,
but I guess that all good things come to an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did a splendid job as leading woman,&#8221; smiled Curt. &#8220;I
wish all of them were like you. Every once in a while the girls they assign to
this unit get it into their heads that they are real actresses and they go
temperamental on us. But you two worked like real troupers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>and took all of
the bumps as they came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they came, too,&#8221; grinned Helen, rubbing her right leg, for
she had slipped and fallen from a horse two days before and her leg was black
and blue.</p>

<p>Curt was silent for a few moments, smiling at the efforts of
&#8220;Skeets&#8221; to round up the last members of the company and get them
aboard the big bus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to stay with us?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Helen. &#8220;Fall&#8217;s almost here and
that means college time. We&#8217;re both awfully young to stay on in
pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t say that. I&#8217;ve known girls younger than either one
of you to make a success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they didn&#8217;t last long,&#8221; countered Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re right on that,&#8221; agreed Curt. &#8220;Are you
going to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect we&#8217;ll decide that when we get back to Hollywood and have a
long talk with mother and dad,&#8221; replied Helen.</p>

<p>Just then Billy Fenstow hurried up, puffing and exceedingly warm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody accounted for?&#8221; he asked his harried assistant.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>&#8220;All
here,&#8221; replied the red-faced &#8220;Skeets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down in the back seat with me,&#8221; the director told the girls.
&#8220;I want to talk with you on the way back to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last members of the company were herded aboard the bus and the girls,
Curt Newsom and the director were the last to get aboard.</p>

<p>They sat down on the broad back seat which had been reserved for the
director. The bus lurched into motion and rolled away from the
ranchhouse.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow mopped his perspiring brow and leaned back to enjoy the
ride.</p>

<p>The dusty road wound through the hills, golden clouds of dust marking the
passing of the bus.</p>

<p>They were halfway to the main highway when the motor started to cough and the
big vehicle slowed to a stop.</p>

<p>The driver buried himself under the hood and tinkered with the engine for a
few minutes. Then he climbed back into his seat and started the motor
again.</p>

<p>They progressed for several hundred yards and finally groaned to a
stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like we may be late in getting to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>dinner,&#8221;
said Curt. &#8220;Sounded like serious trouble under the hood that
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lanky cowboy uncoiled his legs and went out to see if he could be of any
assistance to the bus driver.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow, taking advantage of the stop, spoke to Janet and Helen, his
voice so low that it was doubtful if he could be overheard by any other member
of the company.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about staying in the company for my next picture?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will it start?&#8221; Janet countered.</p>

<p>The director mopped his brow again and grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as soon as I can hash together a good enough story. Two weeks,
maybe three, or it might even be a month. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not certain what we want to do,&#8221; explained Helen.
&#8220;You see, college starts next month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heavens,&#8221; exclaimed the director. &#8220;What under the sun
do you want to go to college for? You&#8217;re smart enough right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it; we aren&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Janet. &#8220;And
we&#8217;re terribly young, if the truth were known.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>Billy Fenstow
looked at them critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, you&#8217;re young enough,&#8221; he conceded, &#8220;but what&#8217;s
that got to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re nothing sensational as actresses,&#8221; replied Janet,
&#8220;and neither one of us would want to go along playing minor rôles for
years. If we ever hope to do more than that we&#8217;ve got to have more of a
background in education and college seems to be the easiest and surest way to
attain that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but you could stay on
with me at one hundred or one hundred and fifty dollars a week for a long
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how many weeks a year would we work at that rate? There wouldn&#8217;t
be more than twenty-five or thirty at the most and our expenses of staying on in
Hollywood would become heavier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you put it that way, you&#8217;re probably right. But when you do
get through college, don&#8217;t forget to come back and we&#8217;ll see how things go
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>The director started to get up, then sank back on the cushions. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>&#8220;You
helped doctor the script of &#8216;Kings of the Air,&#8217; didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
he asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made a suggestion or two,&#8221; she admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard it was a little more than that,&#8221; smiled the director.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you see what you could do with a western script for me. I
haven&#8217;t got an idea and if I turn it over to the studio writers, I&#8217;ll
probably get another stereotyped plot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you serious?&#8221; demanded Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much so. You might be able to put together something with a new
angle. Mind you, it must be simple in action, for I&#8217;ve got to operate on a
slim budget, but we must have a satisfactory love angle and a plausible plot.
Think you can do anything with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try; I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; promised Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I guess I&#8217;ll take a little vacation when we get back to
Hollywood. I&#8217;ll need the story in about ten days, or at least a complete
outline by that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tubby little director lifted himself off the seat and ambled down the
aisle to learn how much longer they would be detained and Janet watched him go
with a strange elation in her heart. </p>

<p>Helen looked at her companion through smiling, quizzical eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you make of that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little bit dizzy, but I guess Mr. Fenstow meant what he said.
Do you suppose I can really turn out an acceptable story for a western
picture?&#8221; Janet turned and shot the question squarely at Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you can. That is,&#8221; she amended, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t
let the thought of it scare you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give it a lot of time and thought before I start writing the
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much time,&#8221; warned Helen, and Janet knew that her
companion was right.</p>

<p>Ten days&#x2014;sometimes it seemed like an endless length of time; then
again it vanished like magic and she had a feeling that this might be the case.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>Some members of
the company left the bus and walked around to stretch their legs; the others
remained quietly in their seats, only a few of them talking for they were glad
the strain of making the picture was at an end.</p>

<p>Janet sniffed the late afternoon air. There seemed to be a faint odor of
smoke, but she decided some of the men in the company must be smoking
nearby.</p>

<p>The heat abated somewhat as they waited for the driver to repair the engine
and a sharp breeze swept down out of the hills sending little swirls of dust
dancing along the winding road ahead of them.</p>

<p>Helen leaned close to her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smell smoke?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, but I thought I did a few minutes ago,&#8221; replied
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can now,&#8221; went on Helen, sniffing intently.</p>

<p>Janet thought she caught another whiff of smoke, but she couldn&#8217;t be
sure.</p>

<p>Curt Newsom, who had been trying to help repair the engine, came back along
the bus. His face was smudged with grime and dirt and his hands were covered
with grease. He raised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>one of them and
motioned for Janet and Helen to join him. The girls left their seats and walked
down the bus, Curt meeting them at the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said sharply and in a manner that was little like
his own.</p>

<p>He strode away through the dry grass, which crackled like tinder under his
boots. He was a good fifty yards away from the bus and far beyond earshot when
he stopped and faced the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be hours before that bus can be repaired,&#8221; he told them.
&#8220;Someone will have to go back to the ranch or the nearest village and
phone for another vehicle to come out from the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The freshening breeze stirred up a cloud of dust which enveloped them for a
moment. Curt sneezed heavily and then sniffed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smell anything?&#8221; There was desperate intentness in his
question.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen wrinkled their noses and sniffed eagerly.</p>

<p>Helen shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, but a while ago I thought I smelled smoke.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;So did
I,&#8221; added Janet. &#8220;It was kind of like tobacco smoke and then it
wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it isn&#8217;t tobacco smoke. I&#8217;ve
been getting whiffs of it right along. Smells like a brush fire to me, but I
can&#8217;t locate any sign of smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by brush fire?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>Curt looked at her sharply and then his eyes swept the rugged countryside
where the sparse grass was brown and the brush as brittle as glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a prairie fire&#x2014;only worse. It&#8217;s even worse than a
forest fire. It spreads more rapidly. Once a fire gets started in this dry,
combustible stuff, it&#8217;s almost impossible to stop it. Either a good rain comes
along or the blamed thing just burns itself out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I should think you could dodge a brush fire,&#8221; put in
Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you could if you knew which way it was going to jump. But it
moves almost like lightning and it&#8217;s on you before you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cowboy star cast an anxious eye over the rolling hills, but there was no
sign of smoke, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>no
spear of flame to flash a warning of impending trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your nose busy and your eyes and ears on the job. You might even
stir around in the hills a bit. If you see anything that looks like it might
spell trouble, let me know. I&#8217;m going back to try and help the driver. We&#8217;ll
give you plenty of time to get back before we start on if we just happen to find
the trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt, his spurs jingling musically, strode away, and Janet and Helen watched
him go with mingled feelings. His words had aroused a very definite sense of
alarm in their minds and they were a little white as they faced each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I smell smoke now,&#8221; said Helen, sniffing intently.
Janet did likewise, but she couldn&#8217;t be sure, and the breeze was getting
sharper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll scout around these hills. Let&#8217;s try that one,&#8221; Janet
pointed to a ragged outcropping of rock that towered above the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be hard to climb,&#8221; cautioned Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but once we&#8217;re on top we&#8217;ll be able to see all over this
country. If there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>any sign of a
brush fire, we&#8217;ll be able to see it from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right. Wish I had left my heavy boots on. These
shoes aren&#8217;t made for this kind of walking,&#8221; and Helen looked down at
the low-heeled, comfortable oxfords she wore. They were all right for street
wear, but when it came to climbing about over thin, rocky soil, they provided
only a minimum of protection.</p>

<p>The outcropping Janet had selected was even steeper than they had anticipated
and as they climbed, the outline of the bus in the valley became smaller. They
stopped several times to rest and on the last occasion Janet sat down on a flat,
sun-baked rock. There was a certain fetid odor about it but she thought nothing
of it until Helen, who was about to sit down beside her, screamed.</p>

<p>Without thinking and so swiftly it must have been a reflex action, she hurled
herself away from the rock.</p>

<p>She dropped in a twisting, rolling fall and as she turned she glimpsed a
venomous head with lashing fangs which flashed out once from the rock and then
disappeared. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>THE SMOKY MENACE</p>

<p>Janet fell heavily, turning over several times before she finally came to
rest against a clump of dry brush.</p>

<p>Helen was at her side almost instantly, her face drawn and tense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it strike you?&#8221; she asked, deep anxiety marking her
words.</p>

<p>Janet, still dazed by the shock of hurling herself to the ground, looked up
and managed a wan smile. She shook her head and with Helen giving her a hand,
got to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m all right. Just scared a little. It was so
sudden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The snake was coiled up on the back of the rock. I saw it just as you
sat down. For a second I was speechless; then I seemed to explode into a
scream,&#8221; explained Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing for me that you did,&#8221; said Janet. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think the snake missed it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>more than inches.
We&#8217;d better get some stout clubs if we&#8217;re going to do any more climbing
around these rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing, we&#8217;re not going to sit down on any of them,&#8221;
declared Helen, who was watching the pile of rocks with open suspicion. There
was still that fetid smell in the air, but no sign of any snakes.</p>

<p>They looked about for sticks which could be used for clubs and Helen found
several sizeable sticks which would serve that purpose.</p>

<p>The incident had unnerved them more than they cared to confess and they sat
down to rest on the sandy soil, taking care that nothing was near them which
would conceal a snake.</p>

<p>The afternoon deepened and the sun was about to sink over the western hills
when they roused themselves and started on toward the summit of the promontory
they had been climbing.</p>

<p>Janet stopped and sniffed the air. The odor of smoke seemed stronger now, yet
there was no visible sign of it.</p>

<p>Helen also smelled it, for the wind, if anything, was sharper now.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a fire burning somewhere near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>here, it might be
bad for us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This dry grass and underbrush would burn
like tinder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Curt fears,&#8221; added Janet.</p>

<p>They stopped to rest once more before they started the final ascent to the
rocky outcropping from which they hoped to be able to survey the entire
surrounding country.</p>

<p>As they started up the final slope, the smell of the smoke became stronger.
Looking back into the valley where the bus was stalled, Janet could see the men
in the company all grouped around the front end. It was evident that the trouble
had not been repaired. Some distance from the bus a lone figure was striding
along the trail, evidently bound for the nearest ranch or village where he could
telephone for another bus and a repair crew.</p>

<p>They toiled up the last few yards to the summit of the promontory and reached
it only to drop down in an open space, gasping for breath, for the last part of
the climb had been arduous.</p>

<p>A sharp cry from Helen drew Janet&#8217;s attention away from the bus, which now
seemed far down in the valley. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s fire burning in that further valley,&#8221; cried Helen, an involuntary note of alarm in her voice.</p>

<p>Janet turned quickly and gazed in the direction Helen was pointing. Her
companion was right. There was fire in one of the distant valleys. From their
elevation they could see a low, creeping wave of smoke shot through with an
occasional tongue of flame.</p>

<p>The wind, riffling past them now, was sweeping the fire in their direction at
a steady pace, but it was at least two miles away, perhaps even further,
estimated Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it look serious?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it does,&#8221; replied Janet quickly. &#8220;One of us
must get back to the bus at once and warn Curt. This is what he&#8217;s
feared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; said Helen, but Janet noted that her companion&#8217;s
face paled at the thought of staying on top of the ridge and watching the fire
sweep toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t. If there&#8217;s any staying to be done up here, I&#8217;ll be
the one,&#8221; decided Janet. &#8220;Besides, I can run faster than you and
your shoes are in no condition to go racing over this rough ground. You start
down now and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>tell
Curt exactly what&#8217;s happening. Tell him the fire is moving steadily in our
direction and I can&#8217;t see that anyone is in front of it attempting to beat it
out or to build barriers to halt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I hate to leave you here alone,&#8221; protested Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that. You get back to the bus. Hurry!&#8221; There was an
anxious note of appeal in Janet&#8217;s last words and Helen flung down the stick
she had been carrying and started back down the slope.</p>

<p>Janet watched her for a time as she darted around outcroppings of rock. Then
she turned and gazed at the low wall of smoke which was being whipped along by
the wind.</p>

<p>From that distance it was hard to imagine that the advancing smoke and fire
could be such a deadly thing&#x2014;that it could lay waste to everything in its
path, leaving, where it had passed, only a sear and desolate landscape.</p>

<p>The wind seemed to be strengthening with the passing of each minute. The
crest of the advancing fire topped the ridge of another valley and started down
the near slope, but it was still better than a mile and a half away.
Occasionally a jet of flame rose higher than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>the others, as
though some madman had tossed a torch high into the air at his exhilaration over
the destruction the flames were causing.</p>

<p>The afternoon was waning rapidly and in the valleys between Janet and the
flames the light was fading. She turned and gazed back down the long slope.
Helen was almost at the bus, making every effort at speed and Janet felt sorry
for her for she knew Helen must be suffering intense pain from her too-thin
shoes for the rocks would bruise her feet badly.</p>

<p>Janet saw Helen reach the bus and the men turned their attention from the
stalled motor to the newcomer. Janet thought she could distinguish Curt Newsom
looming above the others but she couldn&#8217;t be sure.</p>

<p>In less than a minute a solitary figure detached itself from the group around
the bus and started up the slope toward Janet. From the long stride and the
graceful carriage of the body she knew it was the cowboy star, coming up to get
a first-hand glimpse of the advancing fire.</p>

<p>Someone down at the bus turned on the headlights, and twin beams of light
flashed through the gathering purple of the evening. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>Janet heard a
scurrying up the other slope and a jack rabbit, scenting the danger of the
approaching wall of smoke and fire, dashed past her. She knew that later there
would be an onrush of the smaller animals seeking to evade the danger. But for
some reason Janet felt strangely calm.</p>

<p>The fire was still more than a mile away. True, it was advancing steadily,
but the thought of being trapped by flames had never really entered her mind and
she refused to be stampeded now.</p>

<p>She turned back to watch the progress of Curt Newsom as he raced up the
slope. It was almost dusk now where she was standing but she could see him
coming steadily toward her. He would be beside her in another minute.</p>

<p>The cowboy star, puffing heavily from the race up the rocky slope, reached
Janet&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>The smell of smoke was stronger now and the flames were brighter as though
they were eating their way through heavier underbrush.</p>

<p>Curt&#8217;s features were plainly visible in the half light of the early evening
and Janet could see the lines of worry on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse than I thought from what Helen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>told us,&#8221; he
said, shielding his eyes and looking across the intervening valleys to the ridge
down which the fire was now racing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it serious?&#8221; asked Janet. &#8220;Are we in
danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt stared at her hard, wondering just how much he dared to tell her. Then
he decided she might as well know the truth and he spoke frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind&#8217;s rising all the time and this fire&#8217;s spreading rapidly.
We&#8217;ve got to get out of here within the next few minutes or we may never leave
these valleys alive.&#8221; </p>

<p>Janet felt an inward surge of terror sweep over her, chilling her mind and
body. But it lasted for only an instant. She was too calm, too sensible to
become panic stricken now. They might be in a tight spot but she had confidence
that the angular, capable cowboy would be able to pull them through.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get back to the bus and warn them of the danger. Maybe
the boys will have the engine fixed by the time we&#8217;re back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt turned for a final look at the advancing wall of smoke and flame.</p>

<p>A steady procession of small animals, driven from their homes, was racing
through the underbrush and an occasional frightened rabbit would almost bump
into them in its blind haste to find safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Curt. He held out his hand and Janet grasped it.
With the cowboy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>leading the way,
they plunged down the slope. It was risky business, going at that speed, but
speed was essential and they dared a twisted ankle to reach the bus with the
least possible delay.</p>

<p>Janet dropped the stick she had been carrying and grasped Curt&#8217;s strong
wrist with both of her own hands. They were fairly flying down the incline,
Janet&#8217;s legs working mechanically as she followed the lead of the cowboy
star.</p>

<p>They crashed through a low fringe of underbrush and reached the twisting
roadway. Half a hundred feet away was the bus, its lights glowing, but no other
sign of animation coming from the mechanical monster.</p>

<p>The smoke was not yet thick in this valley and for this Janet was thankful
for the other members of the company obviously had not become panicky.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow saw them first.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the fire?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad. We&#8217;ve got to get out of here and without losing any
time. How about the bus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t even cough,&#8221; moaned the director. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>&#8220;Any word
from the man you sent for help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. What&#8217;ll we do?&#8221; There was an anxious note in Billy
Fenstow&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet, but we&#8217;ll do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt strode forward to the front end of the bus where the male members of the
company were grouped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any chance of getting going within the next five or ten
minutes?&#8221; he asked the director, who was almost buried under the
hood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid not,&#8221; came the smothered reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found the
trouble but it&#8217;s going to take about half an hour to get it
fixed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt turned and faced Bill Fenstow.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too long,&#8221; he warned the director. &#8220;The wind&#8217;s
getting worse and that fire&#8217;s coming fast now. In another half hour this
valley will be an inferno. It will be impossible for anyone to live in
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d better start back for the ranch afoot,&#8221; said the
director.</p>

<p>Curt&#8217;s laugh was hard and thin and Janet, hearing it, thought it was a
desperate laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fire would overtake us before we could get near the ranch,&#8221;
said Curt. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>to make a stand
and we might as well make it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; It was the director asking the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can start a backfire and burn off as much ground around here as
possible. While some of us are doing that the others can see what they can do in
getting the bus fixed. If it&#8217;s done in time, we&#8217;ll run for it; if it isn&#8217;t
this is as good a place as any.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen came close to Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it that bad?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it is,&#8221; admitted Janet.
&#8220;Scared?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scared to death,&#8221; confessed Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; admitted Janet. &#8220;But maybe there is something we
can do to help the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every member of the company was anxious and willing to do whatever they could
and Curt Newsom snapped directions at them. Most of the men raced out into the
brush and almost instantly small fires sprang up. They ate their way rapidly
through the undergrowth and as they neared the bus itself were beaten out, the
men using coats, blankets or whatever article they could find in the bus. In
less than <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>ten
minutes there was a growing blackened area around the stalled vehicle. Their
object was to create a large enough burned over area so that the main wall of
the advancing fire would move around them.</p>

<p>Curt told them frankly that the heat would be bad, almost unbearable, but
they could live through it.</p>

<p>The ridge from which Janet and Helen had discovered the fire was outlined
against a sky shot with crimson for it was quite dark now. Small animals,
scurrying before the red menace, were racing past almost constantly.</p>

<p>The fires which had been started around the bus were spreading out in a great
circle, eating their way hungrily along the parched ground. In the light from
them Janet could see Curt stalking here and there, directing one group and then
another, and pausing now to beat down some flame with his blanket.</p>

<p>Both girls felt particularly helpless, for there seemed to be nothing they
could do, and Helen, her light shoes torn and thin, was particularly wretched,
for her feet were sore and bruised.</p>

<p>A sharp cry came from one of the men who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>had remained with
the driver in an effort to get the bus repaired. Someone leaped into the seat,
there was the whir of the starter and the heavy vehicle shook as its powerful
motor thundered into motion.</p>

<p>The driver slid out from under the hood. His face was a smear of grease and
his shirt was badly torn, for he had been working in close quarters. He
stumbled, reeling from fatigue, but someone caught him and lifted him into the
bus. Another man sounded the horn and the fire-builders, led by Curt and Billy
Fenstow, returned to the bus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think the motor will hold up?&#8221; Curt snapped at the
driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to, but I can&#8217;t be sure,&#8221; was the tired reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; The cowboy fired the question at the
director.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of here and get out quick!&#8221; cried the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;ll you go?&#8221; Curt snapped the question back.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow stared at him for just a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hollywood, of course. Everybody in!&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>But Curt laid a
restraining hand on the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;The road ahead curves back directly into the path of the flame. If we
swing around this promontory, we&#8217;ll be cut off ahead and before we can get
back the flames will be over this section of the road. We can only go
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then back to the ranch we go,&#8221; decided the director, and again
he called, &#8220;Everybody in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Members of the company jammed their way into the bus and Curt took the wheel
for the driver was too exhausted to handle the heavy vehicle.</p>

<p>The smoke was thick now and the first flames were licking their way over the
crest of the ridge far above them.</p>

<p>With the motor roaring heavily, Curt threw in the gears and swung the big
vehicle about in a sharp circle. Then, with the headlights vainly trying to bore
through the almost stifling smoke, they raced back down the road.</p>

<p>It was dangerous going, for Curt&#8217;s vision was cut down to less than three
rods, but speed was essential now and they plunged through the smoky night at a
reckless pace. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>THE LINE GOES DEAD</p>

<p>Lights in the interior of the bus were out now for Curt didn&#8217;t dare run the
risk that they might interfere with his vision. The heavy vehicle swayed from
side to side as they bounced over the winding road and Janet and Helen clung to
each other for protection.</p>

<p>Smoke was swirling across the road and the acrid fumes swept through the open
windows of the bus, but there was no time now to close them.</p>

<p>They raced out of the valley they had been in, shot up over a slight rise,
and descended into another valley, the glare of the flames being lost to view
for the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think we&#8217;ll make it?&#8221; gasped Helen, clinging tightly to
Janet&#8217;s right arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; replied Janet. &#8220;The last shots for the
picture are in the bus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying about the picture; it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>us,&#8221;
retorted Helen. &#8220;My eyes hurt; so do my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet couldn&#8217;t help smiling for Helen was very much matter of fact.</p>

<p>There was a sharp report under the bus, like a gunshot or the backfire of the
exhaust. But it was neither and the girls were thrown heavily against the side
of the bus as the left rear tire let go.</p>

<p>The heavy machine swayed dangerously with Curt fighting for control. The
brakes screamed as they ground to a stop and Curt leaped out to survey the
damage. The driver followed him and then Billy Fenstow followed.</p>

<p>The driver turned on his flashlight and Janet could hear Curt&#8217;s muttered
exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can change; we&#8217;ve got a spare,&#8221; the driver said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to and we&#8217;ll have to work fast,&#8221; snapped
Curt.</p>

<p>Under the lashing directions of the cowboy star, other members of the company
turned to and lent a hand. Tools were taken out, a big jack was placed under the
rear axle, and the work started. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>From somewhere
behind came the ominous roar of the fire and the sky behind the ridge they had
just topped crimsoned. Helen, her thin oxfords badly cut, shifted miserably from
one foot to another and longed for a hot bath in which to soak her aching
feet.</p>

<p>While Curt and several assistants wrestled with the task of getting the flat
tire off, the driver managed to get the spare wheel down from its rack at the
rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much air in it,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;There never is,&#8221; snapped Curt, &#8220;but you know how to use a
pump.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow seized the pump, fastened the hose to the valve on the tire,
and bent his tired body to the task of increasing the air pressure in the big
tire.</p>

<p>It was a tedious, wracking job, and the men alternated, working at top speed
for a minute, then giving way to another fresher one.</p>

<p>Curt, scanning the horizon above the ridge, urged them to greater
haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire&#8217;s getting close,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get
under way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow unfastened the pump and Curt seized the big steel wheel with
its huge <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>casing.
Other willing hands helped him get it on the axle. Anxious fingers sped the
bolts into place and they tightened them as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get going!&#8221; Curt yelled at the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that. Throw her in gear and she&#8217;ll come off. That
fire&#8217;s coming fast now.&#8221;</p>

<p>As though in answer to Curt&#8217;s warning, the flames shot over the top of the
nearest ridge and started down. They seemed to be racing now with the speed of a
greyhound, leaping from thicket to thicket with unbelievable rapidity.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen, clinging together on the back seat, watched it with
fascinated eyes. The fire was a living, advancing thing that might surround and
swallow them in its flaming greed. The thought sent a deadening chill through
Janet and for a moment she closed her eyes to the red spectacle.</p>

<p>The motor of the bus roared again as Curt trod heavily on the starter. The
big vehicle pulsated with power and there was the crash of gears as they lurched
ahead and the left rear wheel dropped off the jack. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>Like a
frightened elephant the bus leaped forward, its headlights once more boring
through the smoke-laden night air.</p>

<p>Curt drove with reckless abandon, tramping the accelerator down almost to the
floor boards. His passengers were flung from one side of the lunging vehicle to
another, but they knew that only in speed now lay their hope for salvation and
none of them cried out as their bruised bodies were flung back and forth.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen managed to wedge themselves in a corner where, by clinging
together, they could escape with only a minimum of bouncing about.</p>

<p>Suddenly the road straightened out and the smoke thinned. Janet recognized
where they were. It was the last half mile which led back to the ranch where
they had completed shooting the new picture only that afternoon.</p>

<p>They had outdistanced the racing flames and Curt reduced the wild speed of
the bus. In less than five minutes they swung into the broad yard of the ranch,
but there were no lights in the house nor in the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>Curt blasted sharply on the horn, but there was no sign or sound of life
anywhere. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>&#8220;Looks
like everyone&#8217;s sound asleep,&#8221; said Billy Fenstow, who was rubbing his
bruises gingerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve probably taken to the hills,&#8221; replied Curt.</p>

<p>They unloaded and entered the ranchhouse. Curt lighted a lamp and it was
evident from the disorder in the rooms that the owners had fled hastily. The
corrals were open and all of the stock had been turned loose.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen stopped beside the water tank. Their throats were dry and
tasted heavily of smoke so they drank deeply of the cool, fresh water.</p>

<p>Curt, pausing for a moment, stuck his whole head in the tank, and then drank
from the cup the girls offered him. As he gulped down the water he watched the
crimson horizon northwest of the ranch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like we&#8217;re going to be safe here unless the wind swings around
a little more,&#8221; he observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about the folks. They know what time we were going to
start back and they&#8217;ll be frantic when they hear about the fire,&#8221; said
Helen. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>&#8220;Phone
line may still be up,&#8221; said Curt. &#8220;Go in the house and see if you
can get a call through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen turned and hastened toward the house while Curt rejoined the men, who
were staying near the bus. The driver was buried under the hood again, making
sure that there would be no recurrence of their previous engine trouble.</p>

<p>Janet followed Helen into the ranchhouse. The phone, an old-fashioned wall
instrument, was in the dining room. There was a large plate of cookies,
evidently left from supper, on the table, and neither girl could resist helping
herself to several. Helen munched them as she cranked the telephone and listened
for an answer from the operator in the nearest town. At last the response
came.</p>

<p>Helen, talking rapidly, gave her father&#8217;s address and phone number in
Hollywood. In less than five minutes the call was through and she heard her
father&#8217;s voice on the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Dad. This is Helen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we? Back at the ranch. No, we&#8217;re safe enough. The bus
broke down and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>we
had to turn back when the fire cut us off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t worry, Dad. Curt Newsom says he thinks the fire will swing
around us. If it doesn&#8217;t, we can take to the hills back of the ranch. We&#8217;ll
come through all right. Tell Mother not to worry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that&#x2014;&#x2014;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen repeated the question, then looked blankly at Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;See if you can hear him,&#8221; she urged and Janet took the
receiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Mr. Thorne,&#8221; she said. But there was no answer. She
repeated the question and this time when there was no answer mechanically hung
up the receiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;The line&#8217;s dead,&#8221; she told Helen. &#8220;The fire must have
brought down the poles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls stared hard at each other through smoke-rimmed eyes. The telephone
had given them a sense of security, a feeling of contact with the outside world.
Now they were cut off with the flames behind them and only the rugged hills
ahead. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>THE FIRE SWEEPS ON</p>

<p>When Janet and Helen returned to the spacious ranch yard, they found the men
in the company gathered in a council of war near the bus. They were debating
whether to risk remaining at the ranch or attempt to push on into the hills and
onto higher ground.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow felt the ranch would be safe and was loath to attempt to go any
further, but Curt Newsom, who had been watching the shifting clouds of crimson,
was wary.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little more and the wind will shift enough to bring the fire down
into this valley. Once it&#8217;s here it will travel like a race horse and we&#8217;ll
never reach safety,&#8221; he warned.</p>

<p>The director pointed to several heavy steel containers which held the last of
the shots for &#8220;Water Hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to lug those through the hills?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>&#8220;We could
take turns,&#8221; retorted Curt. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a better one. Are those cans
watertight?&#8221; He shot the question at one of the cameramen.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re safe enough, all right,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s fasten wires to the handles and lower them into the well
here. If we have to run for it, we&#8217;ll not be bothered with these heavy
containers and we&#8217;ll know the last shots are safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow agreed that Curt&#8217;s suggestion was an excellent one and they
scattered in search of a coil of wire. One was found near the bunkhouse. It was
fastened to one of the containers and the heavy steel receptacle was lowered
into the well. The wire was cut and the upper end securely fastened to a timber.
Then the operation was repeated, the second can being lowered until it reached
the bottom of the well. Curt snipped the wire with a pair of pliers and fastened
the end with the first one.</p>

<p>Janet had been watching the skyline intently. Perhaps she was simply
over-wrought, but she felt sure that the crimson glow had brightened as though
the fire was nearer their own valley. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>&#8220;Watch
the skyline,&#8221; she urged Helen. &#8220;See if the glow is
brightening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen peered through the half-light. Then she shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be sure, but I think the fire must be nearer,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Had we better tell Curt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;ll want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls called the lanky cowboy aside and Janet confided her fears to
him.</p>

<p>Curt spun on his heels and stared into the flame-rent sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m imagining things, but it looks bad,&#8221; he muttered.
Then he called Billy Fenstow over to him and the rotund little director agreed
that the fire must be getting nearer.</p>

<p>Curt sniffed the smoke. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting thicker. We&#8217;d better get out
of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the bus?&#8221; demanded the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll use that as far as we can. There&#8217;s a trail that goes at
least a mile back in the hills. After that we&#8217;ll have to go on
afoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orders snapped from Curt&#8217;s lips. Back into the bus piled the company, Janet
and Helen were among the last and they stopped long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>enough beside the
well for deep drinks of the cool water. It might be many an hour before they
would have such an opportunity again.</p>

<p>Curt took the wheel for he knew the trail into the hills. The motor roared
with a heavy song of power and they were away once more, fleeing before the
ever-hungry flames.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen sank back on the cushions of the rear seat. The trail was
soft and sandy and although the bus lurched heavily at times, they had an
opportunity to relax a little.</p>

<p>Helen slipped off her oxfords and rubbed her aching feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for a good, hot bath,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;My feet will never
be the same again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine ache a little even with my boots on,&#8221; admitted Janet. She
would have liked to have slipped out of her boots and wriggled her toes but they
were too hard to lace up again.</p>

<p>Curt was driving with a desperate intentness as the going became more
difficult. The trail had faded into two thin tracks and it was rougher
now.</p>

<p>Sharp rocks protruded and at any moment a tire might give way. But they kept
on boring into the hills. The engine was working
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>hard now as they
ascended a grade and Janet looked back through the broad, rear window of the
bus.</p>

<p>The valley they had just left was plainly visible and topping the ridge above
the ranchhouse were the first racing tongues of flame. They had started just in
time.</p>

<p>Helen turned around and together the girls watched the fire skip down the
slope. When the scene was finally shut off by their own descent into another
valley, the fire was almost to the ranchhouse and Janet felt sick at heart as
she thought of the destruction which was inevitable for the friendly, rambling
old structure.</p>

<p>The trail they had been following faded completely away and Curt brought the
bus to a stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Want to get out and walk or shall we go on in the bus?&#8221;</p>

<p>The director&#8217;s reply came quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt shrugged his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know as well as I do. We&#8217;ve got to go someplace; anywhere to
stay ahead of the fire.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>&#8220;Then jam
the bus along as far as it will go,&#8221; ordered the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to pay for the damage?&#8221; demanded the
driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that,&#8221; snapped Curt. &#8220;The first thing is to
save our own necks. Then we&#8217;ll worry about the bus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll have to report what happened to the company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be lucky to get back and make a report,&#8221; retorted the
cowboy.</p>

<p>They lurched into motion once more, traveling almost blindly now, and much
slower.</p>

<p>Curt felt his way around clumps of underbrush and outcroppings of rock. The
wind, swirling along with them, carried a heavy curtain of smoke.</p>

<p>They were rolling down a long slope when a front tire let go with an
explosion like that from a young cannon and Curt twisted desperately at the
wheel, fighting for control of the big vehicle. The driver jumped to help him
and between the two of them they brought it to a halt without an upset.</p>

<p>Curt jumped out to survey the damage and returned almost at once. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>&#8220;No
chance of repairing the tire even if there was time,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll see how much further we can go.&#8221;</p>

<p>With both Curt and the bus driver clinging to the wheel, they started on,
though traveling at a painfully slow pace.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the valley they stopped, a thin ribbon of a stream blocking
their way.</p>

<p>Once more the cowboy lunged out into the smoke-filled night to stamp through
the shallow waters of the stream. The bottom seemed fairly firm and Curt
returned and took the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to go through, but everyone unload. No use to carry any
excess weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire company piled out of the bus and watched Curt start across the
stream. He made good progress, the front wheels climbing out on the other bank
and for a moment it looked like he was going across. Then the sand gave way and
the back wheels churned up a spray of sand and dirty water.</p>

<p>Curt snapped off the ignition and jumped out of the bus.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re stalled for keeps,&#8221; he informed them, &#8220;but this is
about as good a place as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>we&#8217;ll find.
We&#8217;ll start backfires and then when it gets bad, we can get under a bank along
this creek. There&#8217;ll be water to help us here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under Curt&#8217;s dynamic orders, half a dozen backfires were started, the men
working like mad to clear away the underbrush and destroy all inflammable
material near the creek bank where they had decided to make their stand.</p>

<p>There was little that Janet and Helen could do, but they insisted on seizing
old coats, wetting them in the stream, and using them to beat out the flames of
the backfires when they had spread far enough.</p>

<p>The burned area widened rapidly, but Curt spurred his workers on with renewed
pleas and cajoling. One of the cameramen, slipping away to the bus for a minute,
trained his camera on the scene and started grinding away. The crest of the hill
above them was now outlined in a strong, crimson and the shadowy forms of the
workers were visible as they hastened from one backfire to another. Janet saw
the cameraman working, but she knew their work had progressed far enough so the
absence of one man would not make a great deal of difference. Then, too, she
knew that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>he might
get some shots which would be invaluable in some film needing good fire
sequences.</p>

<p>Fortunately the bank they had selected had been heavily undercut by the
stream and would afford them protection. Curt set several of the men to the task
of digging further into the bank and they worked with improvised tools taken
from the bus.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen soaked the coats they had been using again and returned to
the task of beating down the backfires. Curt joined them for a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better get back under the bank. This thing is going to come down this
slope like a hurricane,&#8221; he warned.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait until the others start down,&#8221; said Janet, but he
took their coats and shoved them toward the creek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get going,&#8221; he ordered, and his voice was firm.</p>

<p>They obeyed, for already the fire was starting down the slope and the girls
hastened to the creek bed.</p>

<p>The water was shallow, not more than six inches deep in any place and the
bottom was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>sandy.
Helen slipped off her torn shoes and wiggled her toes in the cool luxury of the
water. Just then she forgot to worry all about the fire in the pleasant delight
of having her feet comfortable if even for the moment.</p>

<p>Men who had been working on the backfires came tumbling over the bank,
falling and splashing into the water, but no one minded being dirty or
wet.</p>

<p>Janet could hear a roaring that sounded like the beat of scores of kettle
drums&#x2014;a roaring that was increasing in intensity and furore.</p>

<p>Splashing along the sandy bottom, she came to a lower place in the bank where
she could look up the slope.</p>

<p>A solid wall of flame topped the crest, then swept down with an amazing
rapidity. The air was hot and searing like a blast from an over-heated
furnace.</p>

<p>A handful of men were still grouped around Curt, working until the last
moment to spread the backfire as far as possible.</p>

<p>Helen, padding through the shallow water, joined Janet and they watched the
awesome scene together. The roar of the onrushing fire increased and waves of
heat beat against their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>faces. Janet knew
that it must be terrific out on the slope and she wondered when Curt would lead
his men in.</p>

<p>One of them, gasping and choking, ran toward the creek, lunged past them, and
hurled himself face downward in the water.</p>

<p>Seconds later Janet heard Curt&#8217;s cry and the rest of the men, with Curt and
Billy Fenstow bringing up the rear, ran toward the creek bank.</p>

<p>The director stumbled and fell heavily and the cowboy bent down and picked
him up. Carrying the director in his arms, Curt, staggering under the extra
burden, ran on. One of the men leaped over the bank to help and together they
eased the little director into the water.</p>

<p>Curt turned instantly and watched the rushing flames. The roar was so loud
now that it was impossible to communicate with one another except by shouting
and Curt ran from one to another, shouting and pounding them down under the bank
where they would get the utmost protection.</p>

<p>Reaching out he jerked Janet and Helen sharply and jostled them under the
bank. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>&#8220;Get
under there and stay under. Put a wet cloth to your nose and mouth. Don&#8217;t
breath any more than you have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither one of them possessed handkerchiefs, for these articles had gone
astray long before. One sleeve of Janet&#8217;s dress had been ripped and she tore
the whole thing out, ripped it again, and gave Helen one half of it. They dipped
the cloth in the creek, squeezed a little of the water out, and applied the
makeshift mask to their faces.</p>

<p>Burning brands, carried along by the wind, were dropping in the creek now,
hissing and sputtering as they struck the water where they soon became blackened
embers.</p>

<p>Janet, turning toward the opposite bank, saw a clump of underbrush burst into
flame. The fire, whipped by the rising wind, spread out rapidly. Venturing a
peep above the creek bank, a searing blast of heat struck her forehead and she
could feel her hair curl. One glance was enough, for a towering wall of flame
seemed to be rising straight into the sky.</p>

<p>Janet ducked back under the protection of the bank and dipped the cloth into
the water again. She straightened up again and glanced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>toward the bus.
The cameraman who had been grinding away steadily had deserted the bus and was
dragging his camera with him. He reached the shelter of the bank and other
willing hands helped him set up the machine in a position that was well
protected.</p>

<p>It was impossible to hear now and Janet felt Helen crowding close toward her.
They looked at each other through staring eyes&#x2014;eyes that reflected the
inward fear that gripped their hearts. The heat was stifling now. The cloths
they had soaked with water were drying with incredible rapidity and Janet
remembered Curt&#8217;s warning to breath as lightly as possible. Helen, shoeless,
was standing in the water. A hot ember dropped beside them and struck one of
Helen&#8217;s legs before it had cooled. She winced at the pain, but there was no
escape.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the entire opposite slope of the valley suddenly burst
into flame and the intensity of the heat redoubled. Janet held her breath and
dipped down into the stream to wet the cloth again. Helen did likewise a moment
later and they gained some relief.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow and Curt Newsom were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>crouched beside
the cameraman who was still grinding away at the red terror.</p>

<p>Again the cloths on their faces dried and their breaths came in great choking
gasps. Janet felt as though her heat-seared lungs would burst. She wanted to
cry, but the tears were whipped away by the hot blasts.</p>

<p>The flame on the opposite slope seemed to reach a new peak of intensity and
the water at their feet ran crimson. Then the roar lessened, the peak of the
fire was past.</p>

<p>Janet, through smoke-rimmed eyes, saw it sweep over the far crest of the
valley. Scattered fires were left burning in its wake, but the main advance of
the fire had rushed on seeking new conquests.</p>

<p>As the red glow ebbed, they crept out from under the bank and dropped with
abandon into the shallow waters. It mattered little that embers, some of them
still hot, were drifting in the stream, or that the water itself was now
lukewarm&#x2014;it was a haven from the horror that had just passed. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>A WELCOME RESCUE</p>

<p>Janet couldn&#8217;t even guess how many minutes they rested on the stream bed
with the water washing away the aches in their weary bodies. As usual, Curt took
the initiative when he had regained a portion of the abundant vitality that
flowed through his veins.</p>

<p>The cowboy sat up and surveyed the scene. A dozen fires were still burning in
the valley and the horizon ahead of them, tinged in crimson, marked the passing
of the fire demon.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow, digging sand out of his ears and sputtering heartily, was the
first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curt, how in thunder are we ever going to get out of
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The cowboy shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk,&#8221; he moaned, looking down at the once fancy boots which had
never been intended for the heavy work in which they had been used that night.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>Billy Fenstow
groaned in anguish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I guess I&#8217;ll just settle down and wait for a flood to come
along and wash me down the valley or until I come to some culvert where I&#8217;ll
stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cameraman who had ground away steadily through the thick of the raging
flames crept over to his machine. It had been subject to terrific heat and there
was only a small chance that the negative had come through without serious
damage.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many feet did you shoot?&#8221; asked the director.</p>

<p>The photographer squinted at the footage indicator on the camera, but there
was not enough light to note the figures.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the film isn&#8217;t ruined they&#8217;ll be the best scenes of a blaze
like this that have ever been filmed,&#8221; he predicted.</p>

<p>Janet struggled into a sitting position and looked around. Her eyes sought
the bus, with only faint hopes that the vehicle had come through unscathed. If
it had, it would offer their one hope of escape for she felt that repairs might
be made to the tires and if not, maybe they could limp along. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>But her hopes
were doomed to disappointment. The bus was a glowing mass of steel. Fire had
swept over it, igniting the upholstery and burning out the entire interior of
the bus. It was a hollow shell with gaping windows.</p>

<p>Curt Newsom stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use sitting around here wondering what we&#8217;ll do,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If a couple of the boys will come along, I&#8217;ll start back to
the trail and we&#8217;ll keep going until we find someone or can reach a
telephone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two other cowboys joined Curt.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest of you might follow us and get back as far as the ranch.
Maybe there&#8217;ll be a little drinking water left in that well,&#8221; advised
Curt as he started up the trail, hobbling painfully on his twisted boots.</p>

<p>Helen looked at her oxfords. They were in even worse shape than Curt&#8217;s
boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to stay here,&#8221; she said, half to herself and
half to Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;d never make it back to the ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet picked up the water soaked piece of cloth she had used as a mask to
shield her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrap this around one foot and use your piece for your other foot. Then
slip your oxford
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>on loosely. That
ought to ease the pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen looked grateful and tried the suggestion at once. She wrapped the damp
cloth around as tightly as possible and then pulled on her shoes. It was a snug
fit, but there was a soft cushion for her bruised feet to rest upon. She stood
up and tried walking.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s much better. Thanks a lot, Janet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow took charge then.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll start for the ranch and go as far as we can,&#8221; he
decided. &#8220;There may be some shelter there and we&#8217;re in no condition to
stay out any longer than necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the director in the van, the singed and tired band started back for the
ranch. After a short distance they struck the trail. It was faint, but they
managed to follow it without too much difficulty.</p>

<p>Hot blasts of air seemed to sweep down from all sides and breathing became a
painful exercise again. Janet wished that she might have just one cool, sweet
breath of air&#x2014;just one.</p>

<p>Helen stumbled and Janet reached out and caught her companion before she
fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right?&#8221; asked Janet anxiously, for Helen was not of as
sturdy stock as she. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll
make it,&#8221; replied Helen, the words coming from tight-set lips.</p>

<p>But Janet was not so sure that Helen could do it. They fell further and
further behind the others, but at last they topped the final ridge and looked
down in the valley where the ranch had been, where they had filmed so many
scenes of &#8220;Water Hole,&#8221; the new picture.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see the outlines of the ranchhouse but Janet could discern
several large, glowing piles of embers and she knew that even the buildings at
the ranch had been destroyed by the fire. Perhaps the well was still filled with
pure sweet water. Her throat seemed drier at the thought and she turned her full
attention to Helen, who needed a supporting arm for the final, down hill lap of
their journey.</p>

<p>The cowboys were the first to reach the ranchyard and Janet could hear them
ripping the cover off the well. There was a shout ahead of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The water&#8217;s okay. Hurry up!&#8221; It was one of the cowboys, and
the news gave them the courage to quicken their lagging steps.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow handed Janet a blackened dipper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>but she insisted
that Helen take the first drink. There was plenty of water and they all drank
their fill while Billy Fenstow scrambled around the timbers above the well
hunting for the wires which had been fastened to the film containers they had
lowered into the well. He found them at last, but decided they were safer in the
water than any place else.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about going on?&#8221; asked one of the cowboys.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use in that. Someone had used the dipper before we got here, so
that means Curt is up ahead of us and he&#8217;s traveling much faster than we
could. We&#8217;ll do better to wait right here where they&#8217;ll find us. Try and
make yourselves comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the director&#8217;s last words were of little help. The air was still dry
and searing and there was no shelter anywhere. Fires still glowed all over the
valley and little clouds of smoke swept around them.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen walked over to the ranchhouse, but the embers were glowing so
brightly that it was impossible to get very close.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ache all over,&#8221; confessed Helen. &#8220;When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>I finally get into
bed I&#8217;m going to sleep the clock around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count me in on that program,&#8221; nodded Janet. &#8220;Well, we
might as well sit down and keep as comfortable as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they went back to the well for another drink before trying to relax on
the ground.</p>

<p>The men were gathered a short distance away, talking in low voices about
their harrowing escape. They conversed in monotones that soon lulled the
girls&#8217; tired minds and before she knew it Janet found herself dozing. They
were fitful little naps, broken with sudden thoughts of the fire. Then she would
snap to complete wakefulness, only to have her fatigue overcome her again. She
had dozed perhaps half a dozen times when the increasing chill of the air
awakened her.</p>

<p>Helen, curled up on the ground, was breathing steadily and deeply and had not
noticed the change in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Janet scanned the horizon. There was no scarlet in the northwest
now&#x2014;only a dense blackness that seemed to be growing thicker. The
southeastern sky was still vividly flame seared. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>The men had
ceased their talking, but an occasional glow of a cigarette marked the dark
huddle where they had gathered. A slight snore could be heard and Janet
attributed it to their tubby little director. A flash of lightning illumined the
mounting clouds and Janet shivered at the thought of a storm sweeping down on
them after the fire.</p>

<p>Helen must have felt the shiver run through Janet&#8217;s body for she stirred
sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sleep another hour,&#8221; she mumbled, and Janet knew her
companion thought they were back home. There was no need to awaken Helen now.
She might just as well get as much relaxation as possible.</p>

<p>Helen slipped back into a deep sleep and Janet kept a lone vigil. The clouds
swept higher and a distant rumble of thunder came down from the hills.</p>

<p>The men were moving restlessly now and Janet could hear Billy Fenstow
berating the weather. But there was nothing they could do about it except
complain a little and then hope that someone would reach them before the coming
storm broke.</p>

<p>Janet wondered how far Curt and the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>cowboys who had
gone with him had been able to travel. Perhaps their aching feet had forced them
to stop. But, knowing Curt, she had a feeling that he would get through and
bring help to them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Helen sat up, rubbing her blood-shot eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;More fire?&#8221; she asked as the rumble of the thunder smote her
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not quite that bad. Just a thunderstorm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen shivered. &#8220;We&#8217;ll catch our death of cold,&#8221; she groaned,
and Janet had to admit that Helen&#8217;s fears were not unwarranted. After the heat
of the fire and the fatigue, they would be excellent candidates for severe colds
or anything else that happened along.</p>

<p>Several of the men who had been hunting around the ranchyard returned to the
well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t even find half a board,&#8221; one of them reported.
&#8220;The fire swept everything clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow turned to Janet and explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a couple of the boys out looking for some boards or anything we
could use to build a shelter for you girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was thoughtful,&#8221; replied Janet, &#8220;but we&#8217;ll get
along all right.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>Billy grumbled
to himself. He wasn&#8217;t so sure. The girls had stood a lot already and there was
a limit to their endurance.</p>

<p>A patter of rain struck them, the drops sizzling as they came down on the
remains of the ranchhouse.</p>

<p>Janet&#8217;s spirits dropped and for the first time in weeks she felt like
having a good, old-fashioned crying spell, but there wasn&#8217;t any pillow where
she could bury her head and she didn&#8217;t want to cry in front of the men in the
company.</p>

<p>The valley was hushed for a moment. Even the thunder was silent in the
breathless pause that often comes just before a mid-summer storm vents its
fury.</p>

<p>It was during this pause that Helen, watching the hills below the storm
clouds, caught a flash of light. It was too low for lightning and she gripped
Janet&#8217;s right arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a car coming!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Janet turned hopefully and looked in the direction Helen pointed, but there
was no sign of light and she heard an involuntary sob escape from Helen.</p>

<p>Then it came again, two twin beams of light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>cutting around a
hill. Helen was right! A car was coming and Janet, unashamed, felt the tears
flowing freely down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow was talking to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew that lanky cowboy would do it,&#8221; he said, repeating it
over and over as though he were a human talking machine, stuck on a single
note.</p>

<p>A horn sounded a warning note as the oncoming vehicle swung into the
ranchyard just as the sky opened and the first sweep of rain struck the valley.
Forgetting all else, they ran toward the machine, which proved to be a hulking
truck, with a covered top.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen reached the rear. Someone reached down and pulled them under
the shelter of the top. A flashlight blazed into their faces and a strong arm
encircled Janet&#8217;s shoulder. It was Helen&#8217;s father and they knew that their
worries for that eventful night were over. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>NEW PLANS</p>

<p>The sky seemed to open wide and a great torrent of rain descended on the
heat-ridden earth, but Janet and Helen, in the shelter of the truck, were
safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, honey?&#8221; demanded Helen&#8217;s father, and, assured that
his daughter was no more than bruised and weary, he turned to Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Janet?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tired and dirty&#x2014;that&#8217;s all,&#8221; she managed to
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s blankets,&#8221; he said, picking two off a pile on the floor
of the truck. &#8220;Throw these around your shoulders.&#8221;</p>

<p>The air was chill now and the girls obeyed without hesitation for their own
clothes were in a bad state of disrepair.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you find us?&#8221; asked Helen when they were seated on the
floor of the truck, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>bouncing along
toward the main highway which would take them back to Hollywood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curt Newsom got through. We were frantic after the line went dead when
you were talking to us from the ranchhouse. We were coming in the truck and met
Curt and the other two cowboys along the trail. From what they told us we knew
that none of you could stand it to be out in the storm and we made all possible
speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s mother?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Terribly worried.&#8221; He turned toward Janet. &#8220;We&#8217;ll phone
your folks as soon as we get home. The fact that a film company was caught in
the center of the fire was broadcast over a national chain and I&#8217;m afraid they
may be gravely alarmed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call them at once,&#8221; agreed Janet.</p>

<p>They talked at length of their experiences and at last Helen&#8217;s father
turned to Fenstow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lose all of your last-day takes?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe we lost a one,&#8221; replied the other director.
&#8220;We put the film cans in the well. One of my boys shot some swell scenes
of the fire if the camera didn&#8217;t get too hot and ruin the negative.&#8221;
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>&#8220;Then I
suppose you&#8217;ll use a fire in your next western?&#8221; chuckled Henry
Thorne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say,&#8221; replied Billy Fenstow. &#8220;That will be up to
Janet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Janet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to do my next scenario.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not joking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. I&#8217;ve gone kind of stale and I thought she could
inject some fresh material. At least she&#8217;s going to get a fair chance to see
just what kind of a film story she can turn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m predicting that she&#8217;ll do a good job if it&#8217;s anything
like the caliber of her usual work,&#8221; replied Helen&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t count on me too much,&#8221; cautioned Janet. &#8220;This is a
new field and I may get in so deep I&#8217;ll never get anything
creditable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The truck swung around a sharp curve. Ahead of them was a blaze of light from
the headlights of a score of cars which were parked along the paved road.
Raucous squawks of horns greeted the approaching truck.</p>

<p>It was still raining hard, but a trim figure, clad in a raincoat, detached
itself from a group in front of one of the cars and hurried toward the truck.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>&#8220;Hello
mother. Here I am,&#8221; called Helen. &#8220;Both of us are all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She jumped from the truck and into her mother&#8217;s arms. After a brief
embrace, her mother spoke quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t stand here. You&#8217;ll catch cold. Here, get under my coat
and we&#8217;ll hurry to the car. Janet, you stay in the truck until we can pull
along here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Thorne looked down at Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about all in,&#8221; she confessed and she found it hard to
muster a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had enough of Hollywood?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>Janet looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, honestly I don&#8217;t. The way I feel right now all I
want is sleep and lots of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded understandingly and just then the car drove up beside the truck and
they jumped down and entered it.</p>

<p>Henry Thorne took the wheel while his wife and the girls made themselves
comfortable in the back seat. Mrs Thorne very wisely made no effort to ask them
about the events of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>night, but
tucked them in with blankets and before the car had gone half a mile both girls
were sound asleep.</p>

<p>The next thing Janet knew someone was shaking her shoulder. It was Mrs.
Thorne.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re home and you can be in bed in five minutes,&#8221; she said.
Janet rubbed a little of the sleep from her tired eyes&#x2014;just enough so she
could see to get into the house.</p>

<p>Helen, walking ahead of her, moaned now at every step, for her feet had been
badly bruised by the stones.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne hurried ahead to run a tub of hot water while her husband drove
the car around to the garage. With Mrs. Thorne helping them, the girls were soon
in fresh pajamas.</p>

<p>Janet decided on a warm shower and Helen followed her under the spray. Then
Mrs. Thorne treated the bruises on Helen&#8217;s feet and both girls piled into
bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep as long as you want to,&#8221; she said as she snapped off the
light.</p>

<p>Janet didn&#8217;t even hear the click of the switch. She dropped into a deep
slumber, one so heavy that there were no dreams of fires and storms. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>When she
finally awoke it was broad daylight. Fresh, sweet air filled their room. There
was no smell of smoke, no threat of storm, and she wondered, for a moment, if
she could have been dreaming about the night before. It was just possible that
it had been a nightmare. Then she stretched and the aching muscles of her legs
told her that indeed it had not been a nightmare.</p>

<p>Janet looked over to Helen&#8217;s bed. Her friend was still sleeping heavily so
Janet slipped out of bed quietly, donned her dressing gown, and went down to the
bathroom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne heard her moving about and looked in for a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;We telephoned your folks last night,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;d
heard the radio broadcast and were greatly relieved when we told them both of
you were safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks so much. I was so sleepy I forgot all about it,&#8221;
confessed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen getting up?&#8221; asked Mrs. Thorne.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s sleeping soundly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come in to lunch without going back to dress,&#8221; said
Helen&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean breakfast?&#8221; asked Janet. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>Mrs. Thorne
smiled. &#8220;No, I mean lunch, and a very late lunch at that. It&#8217;s well
after two o&#8217;clock now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet, finishing her shower, rubbed her body briskly with a heavy towel, and
slipped the dressing gown on over her pajamas. Then she joined Mrs. Thorne in
the dining room.</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning papers made quite a story of it,&#8221; said Mrs. Thorne,
handing Janet a copy.</p>

<p>A bold headline was blazoned across the entire top of the front page:</p>

<p>&#8220;MOVIE COMPANY ESCAPES FIRE!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, in terse, action sentences, the story told of the narrow escape of
Billy Fenstow&#8217;s western unit. Janet found Helen&#8217;s name and her own
mentioned. She was glad that the story gave Curt Newsom full credit for the
cool-headed work which had saved their lives. Curt deserved every word of
it.</p>

<p>Helen joined them a few minutes later, limping a little for her feet were
still aching from the bruises.</p>

<p>The girls passed the remainder of the afternoon resting and at dinner that
night became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>involved in a
serious discussion with Helen&#8217;s father and mother.</p>

<p>After the dessert, Henry Thorne pushed back his chair and looked at them
quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Summer&#8217;s about over,&#8221; was his opening remark and Janet knew
that he had something on his mind. She had a hunch that she could guess what the
trend of the conversation was to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;You girls made up your minds what you want to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to have his eyes fixed on Janet, as though looking to her for the
decision which would guide Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all I want to try to do the story Billy Fenstow asked me to
do,&#8221; retorted Janet. &#8220;After that I think I&#8217;ll have had enough of
Hollywood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting tired of being an actress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, I&#8217;m just realizing my limitations and after all, I do
want more education&#x2014;the type of broadening education that I can get in a
university.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Thorne swung toward his own daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think, Helen?&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>&#8220;Why, I
haven&#8217;t made up my mind yet, Dad. I like Hollywood, I&#8217;ve been having a grand
time, but I guess I&#8217;ve never really thought of staying on here definitely. It
was understood from the first that this was just a glorious vacation and that
when summer ended Mother and I would go back to Clarion and I&#8217;d go to
college.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect that&#8217;s right,&#8221; nodded her father. &#8220;It did start
out to be just a vacation proposition and you girls can make it that if you
want, but I&#8217;ve a new plan that may appeal to you. How would you like to go to
Radio City in New York for several weeks?&#8221; </p>

</div>

<div>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top: 64px;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span><i>Chapter Twelve</i></p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>THE PREVIEW</p>

<p>The girls stared hard at Henry Thorne. It was so like him to toss off an
important statement in an off-hand manner that it left them almost gasping for
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dad, what do you mean?&#8221; demanded Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I said,&#8221; smiled her father. &#8220;How would you and
Janet like to go to Radio City for several weeks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like it fine,&#8221; put in Janet quickly and Helen chorused her
own agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now tell us what it&#8217;s all about,&#8221; insisted Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little vague on it myself,&#8221; admitted her father,
&#8220;except that the studio is planning an extensive promotion stunt to boost
my last picture, &#8216;Kings of the Air,&#8217; and the general manager, Mr.
Rexler, is going to send a part of the cast to New York City where they&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>put on a radio
drama based on the action in the new picture. The whole idea is to whet the
appetites of the film fans by giving them just enough of the story over the air
to make them rush to the nearest theater and see the actual
picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where do we come in?&#8221; asked Janet. &#8220;We were only very
minor members of the cast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough, but some of the principals are now working on other
pictures and it would be impractical to release them and send them east for a
promotional stunt so some of the lesser members of the company will make the
trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;re lucky to be lesser members,&#8221; smiled Helen.
&#8220;When do we start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly. The release date for &#8216;Kings&#8217; is
next month, so I expect you&#8217;ll leave here in a few weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will give me just time enough to try the scenario for Billy
Fenstow,&#8221; said Janet. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d better start work on it
tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look pretty tired. Better wait until morning when you&#8217;ll be
thoroughly rested,&#8221; advised Helen&#8217;s father. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>They
adjourned to the living room where they gathered around a large table and
discussed possible story plots that Janet could use. She made several notes and
then, with Helen, retired early.</p>

<p>A second night of sleep found the girls feeling greatly refreshed. Henry
Thorne loaned Janet his own portable typewriter and she set it on a low table
beside the swimming pool, found some yellow copy paper in the house, rolled a
fresh sheet into the typewriter, and sat down waiting for an idea to pop into
her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, author!&#8221; said someone from behind her and she swung about
to face Curt Newsom, who had walked up unheralded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Curt. Sit down. My, but I&#8217;m glad to see you. Are you all
right after the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>The cowboy smiled. &#8220;As right as I&#8217;ll ever be. I was scared half to
death that night. Say, I saw Billy Fenstow this morning. The picture&#8217;s all
together now and they&#8217;re going to screen it at the Bijou down the street after
the regular feature. Better be there tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there in fear and trembling,&#8221; smiled Janet. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>&#8220;Oh, I
wouldn&#8217;t feel that way about it. I think you did a lot better than most of the
girls I&#8217;ve had in the company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Curt. That was nice of you to say that, but I realize I have
very definite limitations as an actress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not so hot as an actor,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;About
all I have to do is stick on a horse and shoot a gun loaded with blank
cartridges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t all and you know it,&#8221; reproved Janet.</p>

<p>Curt looked at the typewriter and the blank sheet of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m keeping you from your work. I only dropped in to tell you about
the preview tonight. I&#8217;ve got to get along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m supposed to be generating ideas for Mr. Fenstow&#8217;s next
script,&#8221; confessed Janet, &#8220;but the mental generator seems to have
gone on a strike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the story going to be about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You guess,&#8221; smiled Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you have a young heiress, pretty much spoiled, who
owns a ranch. She&#8217;s never seen it so she goes west for a trip and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>while there
learns that most of her fortune has been wiped out through the declining value
of securities and by embezzlement of some of her trustees. About all she has
left is the ranch and a brother who is pretty much worthless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a grand idea,&#8221; exulted Janet. &#8220;Then of course we
could have a cattle war, some rustling, maybe a vein of gold found on the ranch,
and plenty of action.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re supposed to write the story,&#8221; chided Curt. &#8220;Well,
I must get along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for the help. I&#8217;ll make you coauthor,&#8221; called Janet as
Curt strode toward the street.</p>

<p>Curt&#8217;s suggestion gave her the nucleus of her story. It would be a little
different treatment of the western theme. Janet started working, her fingers
flowing rhythmically over the keys. She wrote simply. All that was required of
her was a good, comprehensive outline of the story. The studio writers would put
in the dialogue.</p>

<p>But Janet&#8217;s interest grew as the story progressed and she found herself
putting in conversation and bits of description of the characters. She was so
absorbed that Helen came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>and stood beside
her for several minutes before she was aware of her presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going strong?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Janet, barely interrupting the smooth flow of her story, nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Preview&#8217;s tonight at the Bijou after the regular feature. Curt
Newsom stopped to tell us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better stop writing now. You&#8217;ve been at it steadily for
more than hour. You want to feel peppy tonight when we go to see the
preview.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet finished the paragraph and pulled the sheet of copy from the machine.
She had written eight pages and the top and bottom margins were narrow. She
wanted to keep on writing, but knew that Helen&#8217;s advice was sound. She wanted
to be rested enough to enjoy &#8220;Water Hole,&#8221; to see herself, for
probably the only time in her life, as the leading lady of a motion
picture.</p>

<p>They met Billy Fenstow at the box office and he handed them tickets for a few
seats which had been reserved for his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nervous?&#8221; he asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little. How is it?&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>&#8220;Wait
and see. Here comes Mr. Rexler.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls turned in time to see the taciturn general manager of the Ace
studio stride into the lobby. Close behind him was Helen&#8217;s father. Janet felt
her heart sink. Here was the chief of the studio on hand to pronounce final
judgment on the picture. But Bill Fenstow seemed unperturbed and she forced
herself to be calm.</p>

<p>They all went in together. The feature was a south sea love drama produced by
a rival studio and it was typical program picture with nothing to make it
outstanding in interest.</p>

<p>Then the picture they had been waiting for flashed on the screen.
&#8220;&#8216;Water Hole,&#8217; directed by Billy Fenstow, starring Curt Newsom
and produced by the Ace Motion Picture Corp.&#8221; Then came the credits for
the story, photography, etc., and finally the cast of characters with Curt&#8217;s
name at the top. Janet felt her heart stop for one breathless moment, Her
name&#x2014;<i>Janet Hardy</i>&#x2014;was the second in the cast and directly
under that was Helen&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Then the picture zoomed away to a fast start with the action that always
characterized a Billy Fenstow production. Janet tried to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>critical, but
she couldn&#8217;t help enjoying the picture and her voice didn&#8217;t sound so
terribly bad as it came out of the loudspeakers.</p>

<p>The picture ended all too suddenly. The house lights came up and Janet found
herself staring at the others, waiting for their verdict.</p>

<p>Rexler was the first to speak. He leaned over and tapped Billy Fenstow on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice show, Billy. Got the girl signed up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy turned to Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about it; want to sign a contract to stay with my
unit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Janet knew that she didn&#8217;t. It had been a wonderful summer,
climaxed in the picture she had just seen with herself as leading lady, but now
she was just a little homesick. Then, too, there was the trip to Radio
City.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not right now,&#8221; she told the director. &#8220;Later, perhaps,
but not now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general manager looked at her strangely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it is the smartest thing you could do. If
you change your mind, let me know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up and stalked down the aisle, but Janet knew now that she would
never change her mind. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>JANET TURNS AUTHOR</p>

<p>Early the next morning Janet returned to the task of writing the story for
Billy Fenstow&#8217;s next picture. The story developed rapidly and she found plenty
of opportunities to provide the hard-riding action for which Curt Newsom was
famous.</p>

<p>She worked steadily until mid-forenoon when Helen joined her in the
garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it going?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lots of fun, and I think I have a fairly good idea. Whether
I&#8217;m getting it across is another thing,&#8221; smiled Janet. &#8220;I suspect
the regular studio writers will think it pretty much a mess when they get their
hands on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care much what they think as long as Mr. Fenstow likes
it. After all, he&#8217;s the one who will accept or reject it and the check you get
will depend on his approval.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet leaned back in her chair and gazed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>at the scudding
white clouds far overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you suppose they&#8217;ll pay if they accept the story?&#8221;
she mused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes they pay thousands of dollars,&#8221; said Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;But only for outstanding books or plays. I mean for little stories
like this; the kind that perhaps have an idea in them that can be developed
further by the studio staff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe a thousand dollars,&#8221; ventured Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be enough,&#8221; said Janet, a faraway look in her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now just what do you mean by that?&#8221; Helen wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand dollars would go a long ways toward guaranteeing me a
college education. Why, with what I&#8217;ve saved out of our salaries this summer,
I&#8217;d have nearly two thousand dollars and I could make that go a long ways
toward four years of college.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve saved a lot this summer, too,&#8221; admitted Helen. &#8220;Dad
and mother were talking this morning. We&#8217;re going back to
Clarion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was silent for a moment. Then Janet spoke. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>&#8220;When
are you going back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon; perhaps next week. But you and I will go on to New York to help
with the radio promotion of &#8216;Kings of the Air.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be happy in Clarion after a summer here?&#8221; asked Janet,
watching her companion closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I will. After all, I&#8217;m a small town girl and all this
amazes and scares me a little. Perhaps when college days are over I&#8217;ll want to
come back and try to make a name for myself in pictures. Dad thinks that would
be wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What school are you going to go to?&#8221; Janet asked the question
with bated breath. They had always planned on going to their own state
university, Corn Belt U., but she thought it possible that Helen&#8217;s father
might have expressed some other preference since their arrival on the
coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Corn Belt U.,&#8221; replied Helen. &#8220;Dad left that entirely up
to me and of course I wanted to follow out our plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet sighed heartily. She was elated at Helen&#8217;s words for it meant that
the pleasant companionship they had enjoyed through high school days could
continue through college. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have lots of fun,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;but if we go on to Radio City for the promotion work we&#8217;ll have to register late. Perhaps we can arrange for that while we&#8217;re home. It isn&#8217;t more than half a day&#8217;s drive from home to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we can, especially if we explain that the trip to New York
will enable us to earn more money for our college educations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Janet, you know we don&#8217;t actually have to earn our way through
school. Dad&#8217;s got plenty and your father is comfortably fixed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, but it&#8217;s a matter of pride. I&#8217;d like to have as much of
my own money as possible for college. If I got in a pinch, I&#8217;d yell for
Dad&#8217;s help, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked on about college plans and were finally interrupted when Mrs.
Thorne summoned them to lunch,</p>

<p>More plans for their return to Clarion were made at the luncheon table.
Packing would have to be started soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pick out our college wardrobes here in Hollywood. Then we&#8217;ll
be sure and have the latest styles.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>&#8220;Maybe
Hollywood styles won&#8217;t be campus styles,&#8221; smiled Janet, &#8220;but I
would like a chance to wear that wonderful gown Roddy made for me to a college
party.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was pleasant to think of their first experience in Hollywood when Roddy,
the famous designer of gowns at the Ace studio, had created gorgeous evening
gowns for them to wear at their first movie premiere. Janet could imagine that
wearing such gowns at a party on the campus at Corn Belt U. would create quite a
sensation, and she thrilled pleasantly at the thought.</p>

<p>After luncheon was over, Janet returned to her writing and Helen joined her
beside the pool, stripping the wrapper off a copy of the <i>Clarion Times</i>,
which had arrived on the noonday mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at this; what nerve!&#8221; exclaimed Helen, shoving the front
page of the paper at Janet. She pointed to a story in the center of the
page.</p>

<p>Janet stared at the headline with unbelieving eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;LOCAL GIRLS FEATURED IN MOVIE.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>Her eyes followed down to the story, which heralded the fact that Cora Dean and Margie Blake, Clarion girls touring in the west, had been drafted for rôles in a western picture by Billy Fenstow, the famous director. Janet read on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Dean and Miss Blake report that Janet Hardy and Helen Thorne also
have rôles in the picture,&#8221; the story said.</p>

<p>It was then that Janet flushed. She could have told Cora and Margie just what
she thought of them if they had been anywhere within hearing distance but
fortunately for them, perhaps, they were a good many miles away.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you suppose the <i>Times</i> got that story?&#8221; asked
Janet, the flush fading from her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Helen with emphasis. &#8220;Cora wrote to Pete
Benda, the city editor, and gave him all of the information which is in the
story. Imagine her telling him &#8216;that we are also in the picture.&#8217;
I&#8217;m certainly going to see that &#8216;Water Hole&#8217; is shown in the
theaters at home. That will kind of spoil their story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet laughed. &#8220;Perhaps Cora and Margie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>did feel that
they had the major rôles. You never can tell what others will think is
important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a joke on them if the film cutters left out the sequence
they&#8217;re in,&#8221; chuckled Helen.</p>

<p>Janet looked at her quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suggest that to anyone,&#8221; she warned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; promised Helen.</p>

<p>Janet handed the paper back to her companion and went on with her work. She
spent most of the afternoon at the typewriter and when she was through, felt
that she had done a good day&#8217;s work. The manuscript would be ready with only
another morning&#8217;s writing.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow, dropping in after dinner for a visit with Helen&#8217;s father
inquired about the story and Janet handed him the first draft of as much as she
had completed.</p>

<p>The little director read it with interest, the lines around his eyes
gathering in little puckers as he skimmed through the typed pages. Janet almost
held her breath through all the time he was reading and she saw Henry Thorne
leaning <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>forward,
trying to read some reaction on Billy Fenstow&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>When the director had finished, he looked up and smiled at Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reads well,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Of course there are a lot of
rough spots, but we&#8217;ll be able to use it.&#8221; </p>

</div>

<div>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>CLOTHES BY RODDY</p>

<p>Janet felt her pulse pounding. Acceptance of the story would mean a great
deal toward swelling her college fund and she leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;ll accept it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your final chapters are as good as these, we&#8217;ll take it,&#8221;
replied Mr. Fenstow. &#8220;Of course we won&#8217;t be able to pay a whole lot
since the studio staff will have to whip it into shape, but we&#8217;ll make it
worth your while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you think it will be?&#8221; this was from Helen, whose
interest in the sale of the story was almost as great as Janet&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow mopped his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be up to Mr. Rexler. I&#8217;d say that it wouldn&#8217;t be more
than a thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; gasped Janet, who had visions of her college fund
mounting in one great jump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe not that much, but I&#8217;ll get all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>I can for you.
Now you finish it up as rapidly as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be ready tomorrow noon,&#8221; promised Janet.</p>

<p>Billy Fenstow left a short time later and after he had gone, Henry Thorne
spoke to them about the journey back to Clarion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that Janet is practically assured the sale of her story, we&#8217;d
better make our plans. Can you be ready to start home next Monday?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls looked blankly at each other. Of course they had known that their
stay in Hollywood was near an end, but to put the date so soon was something of
a shock.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne spoke first.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we can, Henry. But we&#8217;ll almost need a truck to take back
all of the things we&#8217;ve accumulated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have some professional packers come out and make whatever boxes
are needed,&#8221; her husband assured her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve got to get clothes,&#8221; wailed Helen. &#8220;We want to
wear Hollywood styles when we go to college.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father bit the end of his cigar and looked at it thoughtfully. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>&#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you call on Roddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he wouldn&#8217;t do clothes for us; we couldn&#8217;t afford it,&#8221;
said Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might do it for you as a special favor to me,&#8221; grinned her
father. &#8220;As a matter of fact, I think he mentioned something about it the
other day. Wanted to know when you were leaving and said he might be able to do
something for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see him the first thing in the morning,&#8221; said
Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; spoke up Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to finish the
story whether I have clothes made by Roddy or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the fight, Janet,&#8221; said Henry Thorne.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do we go on to Radio City?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have only a couple of days at home. Then you&#8217;ll have to go
on to New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will we be there?&#8221; Janet wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. At least ten days; perhaps more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means we&#8217;ll have to hurry back home and start in to school as
soon as our work at Radio City is over,&#8221; put in Helen. &#8220;I wonder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>how it will seem
to be before a microphone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not any worse than before a camera,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>They talked on at length of plans for their college days and although it was
late when they went to bed, Janet was up early and working at her typewriter.
The final two chapters of her story unrolled easily and rapidly and at eleven
o&#8217;clock she leaned back in her chair. The job was done.</p>

<p>Helen had gone on to the studio to talk with Roddy and Janet was to join her
after lunch. Janet stood up and stretched. Her back ached from the strain of
bending over her typewriter and she went into the house and changed into her
trim swimming suit. Fifteen minutes in the pool washed away the aches and when
she emerged she felt greatly refreshed.</p>

<p>Janet dressed carefully for she wanted to look well when she talked to Roddy.
Mrs. Thorne was the only other one at home for lunch and they enjoyed a pleasant
meal.</p>

<p>Janet picked up the finished manuscript and took it with her to the studio.
She left it at Billy Fenstow&#8217;s office and went on to the building where Roddy
had his office and where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>wizard of design
created the gorgeous fashions that were worn by the stars in the big productions
at the Ace studio.</p>

<p>Helen was in Roddy&#8217;s own fitting room and Janet joined her there. Roddy
appeared in a few minutes and after greeting her warmly, set about the task of
providing her with a new outfit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me just what you want,&#8221; he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m going to college,&#8221; said
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me decide,&#8221; he begged and Janet agreed.</p>

<p>The next hours passed in a swirl of fittings and cloth which was draped this
way and that around them, and when they were through neither girl knew exactly
what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; said the little designer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send them
to your home. It will be a week before they&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks so much,&#8221; said the girls as Roddy waved them out of the
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose he&#8217;s going to make?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know there&#8217;ll be a sport outfit and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>an afternoon
dress; perhaps something for the classroom; about three apiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will we ever pay for them? The materials alone will be more
than we can afford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not worry about that. I have a hunch that there will never be
a bill for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>They met Helen&#8217;s father near the studio entrance and they all drove home
together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a long talk with the general manager,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be in Radio City in about ten days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t mean much time at home,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor much to get to Corn Belt U. and get our late registrations fixed
up,&#8221; added Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that. All those details can be taken care
of,&#8221; said her father. &#8220;Just plan to have a good time in Radio City
when you get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both girls knew that they would enjoy their broadcasting experience in New
York to the utmost. There might be a little fear of the microphone but they knew
that facing a camera couldn&#8217;t be any harder than one of the silent
&#8220;Mikes.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>At dinner
that night they told of their hours with Roddy and speculated again at the
creations which his fertile mind would turn out for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use to try and guess,&#8221; warned Helen&#8217;s father. &#8220;You
never can predict what Roddy will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the following day Janet received a telephone call from Billy
Fenstow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you come over to the studio?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as soon as a taxi can get me there,&#8221; she promised.</p>

<p>Helen and her mother were down town shopping and Janet phoned for a taxi. She
slipped into a fresh dress while she was waiting and then was whirled away to
the studio. Envious eyes watched her go through the gates which were shut to so
many.</p>

<p>Janet found the little director in his office back at stage nine, her pile of
manuscript in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve finished the story and Mr. Rexler has gone over it,&#8221; said
the director, after greeting Janet and waving her toward a chair.</p>

<p>She waited breathlessly for his next words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We both think it will do. Mind, it isn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>anything
sensational, but it does have a new twist or two and can be made into a Curt
Newsom feature very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and picked up a check which was on his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will have to be a great deal done to the story by our own
writing staff, so we felt seven hundred and fifty dollars would be a fair price
to offer for the story,&#8221; he said handing the check to Janet.</p>

<p>She took it mechanically and turned it over. Then looked at the name on the
face of the check. It was payable to Janet Hardy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks so much, Mr. Fenstow. It&#8217;s very satisfactory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad you won&#8217;t stay on. I&#8217;d give you the lead,&#8221; he
urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;ve made up my mind. Perhaps when college days are
over, I&#8217;ll come back and apply for a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get one if I&#8217;m still on the lot grinding out
westerns,&#8221; he promised.</p>

<p>Janet left the little office and walked across the sprawling motion picture
plant. It was probably her last visit for the hours left before their departure
would be filled with thoughts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>of packing. It
was a dull time at the studio, with only one or two pictures in production, but
with the coming weeks every sound stage would be humming with activity as new
celluloid dramas were rushed to completion for the entertainment of millions of
movie fans. Janet knew that she would not be a part of it, but there was a
tremendous satisfaction in recalling the experiences of the past weeks and
looking forward to the new ones that were bound to come at Radio City. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>HOMEWARD BOUND</p>

<p>Hours filled with packing and last minute details took their time up almost
until the actual hour of the departure of their plane. They finished finally at
midnight and they were to take the four o&#8217;clock eastbound plane for the
midwest. New schedules had been inaugurated since they had come west and they
would be home in time for dinner that night.</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s mother came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You girls must get some sleep, or you&#8217;ll look pretty much worn out
when you reach Clarion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too excited to sleep,&#8221; confessed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s take a swim in the pool. That ought to relax us,&#8221;
urged Helen.</p>

<p>They slipped into their suits and for nearly half an hour enjoyed the pool.
The moon was well up in the cloudless sky and it was an ideal night. Neither
girl said very much, just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>floated on the
pool, wondering what the coming weeks would have in store for them.</p>

<p>When they finally emerged from the water they were ready to call it a day and
they were sound asleep by one o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne called them at three. It was still dark, but a hot breakfast was
ready for them in the dining room. Even up to the last minute it seemed as
though there were a host of things to do and they took a final survey of the
house before they closed their bags. Two cabs were waiting; one for them and the
other to take their bags.</p>

<p>It was exactly three-thirty when they started for the airport. The streets
were deserted and lights were on in only a few of the homes. Their cab swung on
to a boulevard and flashed past the entrance of the Ace studio. Janet caught
only a glimpse of the plant, but she felt a queer tightening of her heart, and
she wondered if she had been wise in deciding to leave Hollywood. But it was too
late now. She had made her decision.</p>

<p>At the airport the big twin-motored transport was on the ramp, its motors
idling and flickers of blue flame coming out of the exhaust under the wing.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>An attendant
at the gate checked the tickets Henry Thorne held in his hand and they were
escorted to the plane where their stewardess assigned their seats. The cabin of
this ship was even more luxuriously furnished than the one in which they had
flown west and Janet settled herself comfortably into the thickly upholstered
chair. Their baggage was stowed in the tail of the plane and then she saw the
pilots come out of the office.</p>

<p>They stepped into the cabin and walked up the narrow aisle to their own
compartment. Both of them were youthful and Janet wondered that they had the
marvelous skill in their hands necessary to guide the huge plane on its
flight.</p>

<p>Two more passengers hastened up to the gate and were escorted to the cabin.
Then the stewardess checked the list of reservations. In addition to Henry
Thorne and his party, there were only the two late-comers, both of whom were
men.</p>

<p>The motors roared and the plane rolled ahead, gaining speed rapidly. Before
Janet knew it they were off the ground and soaring into a half light of the
early day. A blanket of lights unfolded beneath them, but the lights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>were strangely
dim and the plane headed away for the mountains, climbing steadily to have
safety in crossing the dangerous peaks.</p>

<p>Night faded rapidly now and they were well into the mountains at sunrise.
They were heading northeast, flying now over great stretches of desolate land
where there was nothing but sand and sagebrush, and sometimes precious little
sagebrush.</p>

<p>Salt Lake City was beneath them almost before they knew it and when the plane
landed there Janet and Helen got out to stretch their legs while the crews were
changed and the plane refuelled. Then they were in the air again, climbing once
more to get above the continental divide and after that came the descent to
Cheyenne. Lunch was served aboard the plane with Omaha the next stop and they
roared on east as the sun rolled westward.</p>

<p>Janet was watching the landscape below closely now for this was her home
state&#x2014;a land dotted with many farms and huddles of houses that were the
villages, tied together by strips of white highway and an occasional train that
seemed to be puffing along a ladder which had been laid on the ground. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>Almost before
she knew it the motors of the plane lessened their roar and a town appeared
underneath. It was Rubio, the nearest regular stop on the transcontinental
line.</p>

<p>The giant transport settled down easily. Janet felt the wheels touch and she
looked eagerly through the heavy glass of the window for the first glimpse of
her father and mother.</p>

<p>She saw them on the ramp, gazing anxiously at the plane as it wheeled up to
the concrete slab.</p>

<p>Janet, the first out of the plane, ran to greet them. Her mother embraced her
affectionately and her father gave her a hearty hug.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but it&#8217;s good to see you!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
missed you so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve missed you, but I&#8217;ve had a grand time,&#8221; replied
Janet, locking her arms in theirs.</p>

<p>The Thornes came up and there were greetings all around. Then Henry Thorne
and Janet&#8217;s father supervised the loading of the luggage into the Hardy
sedan.</p>

<p>The car was crowded, but they had so much to talk about and were so eager to
say it that the inconvenience of short space mattered little. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>Taking turns,
Janet and Helen, rather breathlessly, told the story of their summer in
Hollywood while John Hardy whirled them smoothly and safely along the ribbon of
concrete that led from Rubio to Clarion.</p>

<p>They stopped at the Thorne home and unloaded most of the luggage
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re coming over to dinner,&#8221; Mrs. Hardy told them. &#8220;Is
six-thirty all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there,&#8221; promised Mrs. Thorne, who was anxious for all
of the news of her friends in Clarion.</p>

<p>When they were home, Janet and her father and mother sat down in the
comfortable living room and she told them more in detail of her adventures in
the west, of the making of the western films and of their narrow escape from
death in the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were greatly worried by the radio report,&#8221; said her father,
&#8220;but the call from the Thornes reassured us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet&#8217;s mother spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going on to New York City?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother. We&#8217;ll only have a few days at home. Then Helen and I
are to go on to New York for a few days for a promotional broadcast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>on Mr.
Thorne&#8217;s new picture, &#8216;Kings of the Air.&#8217; You know, we had minor
rôles in it and some members of the cast are being sent east to take part in
this promotion work. I think it will be great fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about college?&#8221; her father wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the things I&#8217;ll have to see about while I&#8217;m home
this time. Maybe you would drive Helen and me over to Corn Belt U. some time
tomorrow or the next day so we could see about registration? We&#8217;ll have to
arrange to enter classes late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go tomorrow,&#8221; nodded her father. &#8220;I&#8217;ve arranged
to spend most of the rest of the week at home. Mother and I want to hear
<i>all</i> about Hollywood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see it all,&#8221; smiled Janet. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a grand
place, at least in which to spend one summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Thornes arrived promptly at the dinner hour and they visited at length
over a leisurely meal. At eight o&#8217;clock Henry Thorne glanced at his
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;The manager of the Pastime telephoned just before dinner to say that
he had received
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>a print of
&#8216;Water Hole,&#8217; a new western, and would add it to his regular program
tonight. Think you&#8217;d like to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Janet, isn&#8217;t that the picture you and Helen were in?&#8221;
asked her mother.</p>

<p>Janet nodded and turned to Henry Thorne, who was smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you had that print of the film shipped east on the plane
with us,&#8221; she accused.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; he parried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Janet&#8217;s mother. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
leave the dishes right on the table. It isn&#8217;t every day that I get such an
opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen slipped away from the table and Janet could hear her at the phone
calling for Pete Benda, the city editor of the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete? This is Helen Thorne. Yes, I&#8217;m back in town. Drop in at the
Pastime this evening if you&#8217;d like to see the parts that Cora Dean and Margie
Blake took in that western picture they wrote you about. No, never mind a story
about us now. We&#8217;ve had plenty of publicity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen hung up the receiver and turned to face Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that was nice?&#8221; asked Janet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>but there was an
upward twist of her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it wasn&#8217;t exactly nice, but it was a lot of fun,&#8221;
conceded Helen.</p>

<p>There was just a tang of fall in the air and they slipped on light jackets,
deciding to walk to the theater, which was less than half a dozen blocks
away.</p>

<p>Janet&#8217;s father insisted on buying the tickets for the party and they had
excellent seats well down in the front of the theater. Janet thought she saw
Pete Benda slide into a seat ahead of them, but she couldn&#8217;t be sure.</p>

<p>The regular feature came to an end and the western, which had been added,
flashed on the screen. Janet felt her pulse quicken as the title and the cast of
characters, with her own name under Curt Newsom&#8217;s. The action started and she
glanced at her father and mother. They were completely absorbed in the
picture.</p>

<p>Janet enjoyed it thoroughly. After all, it <i>was</i> a pretty good picture
for a western and the clothes Roddy had designed for Helen and her added just
the right touch of smartness.</p>

<p>The action came to a driving climax and then the picture was over and people
around <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>them
started to leave. As they walked down the aisle Pete Benda joined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulations, girls. That was a nice show. Say, where were Cora and
Margie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see them?&#8221; asked Helen naively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t kid me,&#8221; growled Pete. &#8220;Where were
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had been looking closely at the crowd in one of the scenes in
the town you would have seen them,&#8221; smiled Helen. &#8220;Better come
tomorrow night and look again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I will,&#8221; admitted Pete, &#8220;but if I do it will be to
look at Janet and you. Say, what&#8217;s this I hear about you going on to Radio
City?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something that will keep,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;See you
later.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the way home Janet&#8217;s father and mother told her how proud they were of
her work and she felt a real sense of elation, for compliments from them meant
more than from anyone else.</p>

<p>It was well after midnight when she finally went to sleep in the bed in her
own attractive room. Tomorrow there would be the trip to Corn Belt U. and then
on to New York in a few days. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>GORGEOUS GOWNS</p>

<p>The next morning both the Hardy and the Thorne households were up early for
it had been decided to make the trip to Newton, the seat of Corn Belt U., during
the morning. The girls could complete their plans for registration during the
afternoon and in the evening they could return home in good time.</p>

<p>Janet was nearly through breakfast when an express messenger called at the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Package for Miss Janet Hardy,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Air express,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet signed for the package. It was long and unusually well wrapped and when
she saw the return address, &#8220;Ace Motion Picture Corp., Costume
Department,&#8221; she tingled all over, for she knew that inside were the
dresses George Roddy, or Adoree as he was know professionally, had created for
her.</p>

<p>Janet&#8217;s mother helped her rip aside the heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>brown paper with
which the cardboard box was wrapped. Inside were layers of tissue and then they
gazed upon the first dress, a sport outfit of green wool in lines so plain that
its daring was startling. The jacket fitted snugly with a tie about the throat
and the ends extended over Janet&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>After that came an afternoon dress, a rich brown velvet that caught and threw
back at them the morning light. The skirt was plain with the upper half of the
dress in a Russian blouse design with the plain roll collar of cloth of
gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s the most gorgeous thing I&#8217;ve ever seen,&#8221; exclaimed
Janet&#8217;s mother. &#8220;How did this all happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Briefly, Janet told how Roddy had taken an interest in them and in seeing
that they had attractive and striking clothes.</p>

<p>There was one more dress, a garment designed for classroom wear. This was a
corduroy&#x2014;a deep blue that was dazzling in its intensity.</p>

<p>Before Janet could get it completely out of its heavy tissue wrappings the
telephone rang and when she answered Helen&#8217;s excited voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>came tumbling
over the wire. She, too, had received her box from Roddy&#x2014;a sports outfit,
an afternoon dress and another dress for classroom wear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s wear one of our new dresses when we go to the university to
register,&#8221; said Helen, and Janet agreed. Each of them had corduroys and
they decided to wear these.</p>

<p>Janet took the last garment, the corduroy one, from its wrappings and hurried
upstairs to try it on. Her mother hastened after her, as eager as Janet to see
how the new dress fitted and looked.</p>

<p>Janet wriggled into the cool, smooth garment and whirled to face her mother.
Her hair was a bit touseled and her cheeks flushed from the excitement and the
vivid blue of the dress only heightened her youthful charm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look beautiful, dear,&#8221; breathed her mother. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never seen anything more lovely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet turned back to her mirror and gazed at the dress Roddy&#8217;s agile mind
had conceived for her. It <i>was</i> striking.</p>

<p>The blue corduroy hung well, fitting closely around her slim hips and opening
at the throat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>with a
semi-military cut. A neat little pocket was placed just above her heart. The
sleeves were wrist length, rather full at the shoulders and tapering to a close
fit just above her hands where they were caught and tied with two silver
bands.</p>

<p>Someone came pounding up the stairs. It was Helen, who burst into the room
like a young hurricane. Like Janet, she was attired in one of her new dresses.
It was corduroy, but of an umber hue that was set off to perfection by Helen&#8217;s
dark hair and the olive coloring of her face. There was just enough difference
in the two dresses to make them varied, yet at a glance an observer could tell
that they had been created by the same master hand.</p>

<p>Helen even had on brown hose and shoes that matched her dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are your new shoes?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>Janet delved further into the box. At the bottom was a shoe box and she
opened it with shaking fingers. This was more than she had ever dared imagine.
She drew forth a pair of blue kid slippers and tucked in them were three pairs
of blue hose to match her dress and shoes. She changed shoes and hose and stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>up again,
whirling in front of the mirror. The costume now was perfection itself. She ran
a comb through her golden hair and knew the thrill that comes from knowing a
costume is perfect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose we&#8217;ll be asked to join a sorority at school?&#8221;
asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they see you in these dresses I imagine you can join any or all of
them,&#8221; smiled Mrs. Hardy. &#8220;Come now, we must be ready when the men
want to start.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the echo of her words a horn sounded below. Janet dabbed a little powder
on her face and joined Helen as they hurried down stairs. Even their fathers
were elated over the new dresses and both girls felt that their cups of
happiness were filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly,&#8221; confided Helen, &#8220;I hate to wear this in the
car. I&#8217;d like to take it off and then put it on when we get near
school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;d like to ride all of the way wrapped up in a blanket
or something,&#8221; chided Janet. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll admit that I hate to sit
down in this dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a beautifully clear morning and John Hardy sent his big car speeding
over the paved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>road at a fast
pace. They were in Newton in ample time to drive around the university grounds
and have a leisurely lunch before going to the office of the dean of women to
take the first steps in registering.</p>

<p>The campus of Corn Belt U. was lined with stately elms that had watched over
the destiny of the school for more than three quarters of a century. The main
buildings were of Indiana limestone with a few of the older ones of red-faced
brick, now well covered with a rich growth of English ivy.</p>

<p>Janet knew that she would enjoy going to school here. There was a spirit of
calm and dignity about the campus that appealed to her.</p>

<p>At lunch they talked of plans for school and of what they would take.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get all of the dramatics and English I can
absorb,&#8221; declared Helen. &#8220;Perhaps a little history,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Janet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think my major courses will be journalism, and perhaps just a little
in the way of dramatics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not thinking about going back to Hollywood and joining Billy
Fenstow&#8217;s company
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>when you&#8217;re
through, are you?&#8221; chided the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I might have that idea in mind if no newspaper will take me on
as a reporter,&#8221; conceded Janet.</p>

<p>Luncheon over they went directly to the administration building where, after
a short wait, they were ushered into the office of the dean of women.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laird was a pleasant woman of about fifty and Janet saw her keen eyes
take in every inch of their costumes in a glance and she thought she saw just a
trace of suspicion arise in the dean&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Janet&#8217;s father explained their mission, pointing out that because of their
coming trip to Radio City they would be late in taking up class work.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little unusual to arrange registration in this way,&#8221;
said the dean, &#8220;but I believe you can be accommodated.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an hour they went over class schedules, the dean advising them on the
courses best suited to what they had in mind. She assisted them in filling out
the final registration cards and paused at one question. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>&#8220;Do you
hope to join a sorority?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t be here in time for the rushing parties,&#8221; replied
Janet. &#8220;Perhaps that had better wait until another semester, that is, if
any of the groups should want us for membership.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dean&#8217;s cool eyes surveyed the fashionably dressed girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather imagine you could take your pick of the sororities right now
if the girls were here,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The registration was over. The girls were to have rooms in Currier Hall, an
old but comfortable dormitory.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dean seemed a little cool,&#8221; said Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed that, too,&#8221; Janet said. &#8220;Evidently she doesn&#8217;t
think much of the plans which call for us hurrying away to New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be helped; we&#8217;re going,&#8221; said Helen.</p>

<p>When they returned home a telegram was waiting for Henry Thorne.</p>

<p>&#8220;This interests you girls more than it does me,&#8221; he said, handing
the message to his daughter.</p>

<p>Helen read it eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have Janet and Helen report next Monday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>morning at Radio
City at ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means we&#8217;ll have to leave here Saturday night. Why, that&#8217;s
only tomorrow night!&#8221; gasped Janet. </p>

<p>They were so busy until after dinner that night that Janet had no time to
scan the evening paper. When she picked up the <i>Times</i> it was with pleasant
surprise for in the middle of the front page was a story by Pete Benda,
reviewing &#8220;Water Hole&#8221; and describing the rôles Janet and Helen
played.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Hardy gave a most pleasing portrayal in the rôle of the
heroine,&#8221; Pete had written, &#8220;and a good many local people will enjoy
this picture to the utmost. It is far above the average western.&#8221;</p>

<p>Near the end was a line. &#8220;Cora Dean and Margie Blake, local girls who
were also in the picture, may be seen in a crowd scene at the village.&#8221;
Janet smiled as she thought of the humiliation that Cora would feel. Well, it
had been a mean trick of Cora&#8217;s to write Pete Benda that she and Margie had
leading rôles. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>Helen&#8217;s
father made complete plans for their trip to New York for the Ace company was
paying all expenses as well as salaries to Janet and Helen while they were in
the east.</p>

<p>Both Janet and Helen packed the new dresses Roddy had sent them in the large
bags which they were taking with them. There might be little actual opportunity
to wear them, but they wanted to be prepared.</p>

<p>Their train for Chicago left at ten o&#8217;clock and they arrived at the station
in ample time, Janet&#8217;s father conveying them there. He had reserved a drawing
room for them and they felt elated over that.</p>

<p>The <i>Chicago Limited</i> was on time to the minute, the puffing locomotive
drawing its long string of Pullmans to an easy stop. The girls had drawing room
A in car fifty-seven. The porter took their bags as they turned to say good-bye
to their parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got plenty of money?&#8221; Janet&#8217;s father asked in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty, Dad. And I&#8217;ll get paid while I&#8217;m in New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he slipped her a small, black book that resembled a check book. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>&#8220;Put
this in your purse. It will come in handy if you have an emergency,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Calls of &#8220;Bo-o-oard,&#8221; rang along the train. Final good-byes were
said and the girls stepped into the vestibule of their car. The train started
easily and they waved to their parents. Then they were out of the train shed,
picking up speed rapidly for the remainder of the night run to Chicago.</p>

<p>They retired to their drawing-room, finished in restful tones of rose and
gray, and slipped into pajamas. Both being tired, they went to bed at once,
Janet in the upper berth and Helen in the lower.</p>

<p>The car was air conditioned and they slept restfully, neither one of them
awakening until they were in the outskirts of Chicago.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to wear today?&#8221; asked Helen, stretching
luxuriously between the crisp, cool sheets.</p>

<p>&#8220;My corduroy dress,&#8221; said Janet. &#8220;It&#8217;s excellent for
travel; comfortable and it won&#8217;t muss easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That appeals to me,&#8221; replied Helen, slipping out of bed and
starting to dress while Janet lowered herself out of the upper. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>The train was
past Englewood by the time they were dressed and their porter came in to take
their bags.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to wear a hat?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with this dress; I haven&#8217;t anything that goes well with
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet tipped the porter and a red cap, waiting on the platform, took their
bags. Their New York train was only four tracks away and would depart within an
hour so their bags were taken directly to the Pullman, where another drawing
room had been reserved for the Chicago-New York trip.</p>

<p>After making sure that their bags were in the drawing room, Janet and Helen
went into the great, high ceilinged dining room in the station. They enjoyed a
hearty breakfast of delicious country ham and eggs with crisp toast and a cool
glass of milk.</p>

<p>Janet bought several morning papers and they returned to the train shed.
Trains which had been rushing across the plains all night in their dash for
Chicago were still arriving, while on other tracks long strings of coaches,
ready to start carrying passengers away from the city, were being backed down
the tracks. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>Re-entering
their New York train, they found seats in the luxurious limousine-lounge car at
the rear of the train where the observation platform was enclosed in glass. A
radio was tuned softly and all of the latest magazines were available.</p>

<p>Travel was light that day and at the start of the trip they were the only
ones in the lounge car as the train rolled smoothly out of the station.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause at Englewood, then they were off again, picking up
speed as the train skirted the southern edge of Lake Michigan where great
industrial plants were perched along the shore and lake freighters seemed to
spring out of the prairie as the rails crossed canals.</p>

<p>At lunch time they were well into Indiana. Only a few more passengers had
boarded the train and they had the dining car practically to themselves.</p>

<p>As the afternoon advanced they dipped into Ohio and stops were more frequent.
By late afternoon the train was well filled and space in the lounge car was
almost at a premium.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen went to bed early that night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>for the coming
day promised to be an unusually busy and exciting one for them&#x2014;they would
have their first glimpse of New York, visit Radio City, and receive their
assignments for the radio play they were to be in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to wear tomorrow?&#8221; asked Helen as she
snuggled down between the crisp sheets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, perhaps the corduroy dress I had on today,&#8221;
replied Janet. &#8220;It&#8217;s so comfortable and I think it&#8217;s
becoming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll vote that way, too,&#8221; said Helen, and a minute
later both girls were asleep.</p>

<p>They were up early the next morning, breakfasting as the train sped out of
the Jersey hills and straightened out for its dash across the tidewater flats to
Jersey City. They shot past commuter trains at almost regular intervals for
their limited had the right of way.</p>

<p>As they neared the terminal, the porter took their bags and Helen handed him
a tip. Her father had deliberately routed them over a line which ended in Jersey
City so that they might have their first real glimpse of the towering New York
skyline from a ferryboat.</p>

<p>The passengers poured off the train and onto
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>the nearby
ferry. Bells clanged, smoke rolled from the twin stacks, and the bulky boat
nosed out into the river.</p>

<p>Helen crowded close to Janet as the full majesty of the skyline was unfolded.
To their right was the lower city with its cluster of skyscrapers while to their
left was mid-town with the Empire State towering almost into the clouds. A
little beyond that the sharp spire of the Chrysler building rose skyward.</p>

<p>On the New York side of the Hudson liners were sandwiched into the docks and
Janet grabbed Helen&#8217;s arm and pointed to one. It was the <i>Europa</i>, famed
speed liner. A little further along was the <i>Rex</i>, pride of the Italian
merchant marine.</p>

<p>Then the ferry was nosing into its pier. Gates clanged, their baggage was
loaded aboard a taxi, and almost before they knew it they were whirling away
toward the heart of the city. Helen had given their hotel address.</p>

<p>Up onto an elevated roadway sped their cab where it rocketed along at
forty-five miles an hour. Then they shot onto an incline and eased down into a
street below. Traffic lights slowed them up now, but in less than ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>minutes after
leaving the ferry they were in Times Square, the very heart of the throbbing
city, where Broadway and Seventh Avenue cross to form a great triangular
opening.</p>

<p>At the hotel desk Janet registered for both of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were to have reservations,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The clerk checked the registration list and marked their names off. Then they
were whisked away to their rooms, high up and on the inside, where they could
sleep in something like quiet. They had two rooms with a connecting bath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of the city?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still a little breathless,&#8221; admitted Janet. &#8220;Los
Angeles was large&#x2014;but New York&#x2014;it just seems to swallow you
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>They dressed carefully in preparation for their trip to Radio City and at
nine-thirty o&#8217;clock went down stairs and inquired the best way to reach their
destination. The clerk on duty suggested that they walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a short distance. Go one block to Sixth Avenue, turn to
the left, and continue six blocks to Radio City.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>The morning
air was clear and cool as they set forth, walking briskly and taking in
everything about them. On Sixth Avenue elevated trains rumbled overhead, but up
the street they could see the towering building which housed Radio City and
their steps quickened.</p>

<p>They reached their destination in a few minutes and turned to the right to
the entrance which led to the offices of the World Broadcasting Company, the
chain which was to put their program on the air. The lobby was of chromium and
black and they stepped into a modernistic elevator that whisked them upward so
rapidly they were breathless.</p>

<p>They stepped out at the twenty-seventh floor and into a luxuriously furnished
lobby where there were comfortable chairs and restful lights. A young woman at
the reception desk looked up as the girls advanced.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re to join the company from the Ace studios,&#8221; Janet
explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your names?&#8221; The inquiry was purely impersonal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janet Hardy and Helen Thorne.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young woman checked their names and called a page. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>&#8220;Take
them to studio K,&#8221; she directed.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen turned and followed the page, who was leading them to a new
chapter of their lives&#x2014;one more thrilling than they could have imagined
even in their deepest dreams. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>IN RADIO CITY</p>

<p>The page ushered them into the studio and the first person they saw was Curt
Newsom, the tall cowboy star who had also had a part in &#8220;Kings of the
Air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt hastened to greet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you get in?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning,&#8221; replied Janet. &#8220;My, but it&#8217;s good to see
you again. I didn&#8217;t know you were going to be in this promotional
unit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cowboy flushed and grinned somewhat sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to tell the truth, I&#8217;ve always wanted to try broadcasting a
little and I finally pestered the general manager out on the coast until he sent
me along and ordered them to give me a part. Come on and meet the director of
this unit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt led them over to a small group where a rather slender, dark-haired man
was speaking. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>He
turned to face them as they approached and Janet noted that he wore unusually
thick glasses, indicating that his eyes were in need of heavy correction.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Ben Adolphi,&#8221; said Curt, by way of introduction.
&#8220;Mr. Adolphi has been assigned by the World Broadcasting Company to handle
this promotion work.&#8221;</p>

<p>He introduced each of the girls to the radio director and Mr. Adolphi smiled
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall get at your parts presently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Please be
seated.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found comfortable chairs at one side of the studio and Janet enjoyed the
opportunity to look around the room for it was here that they would put on their
radio show. The ceiling was high and evidently covered with a cloth which
absorbed sound readily. The walls were also covered with a cloth of heavy
texture and the carpet on the floor felt an inch thick.</p>

<p>At the rear of the room was a low platform which might be used for an
orchestra and to the left, through a heavy plate glass window, was the control
room where the engineers regulated the volume of the program and fed it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>out on the air.
Near the door was a desk with a microphone on it for the announcer, and beyond
that was a tall steel stand with several microphones, attached to adjustable
arms, on it. These could be placed in any portion of the room to pick up the
program to the best advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. Adolphi joined them within a few minutes. He carried a handful of script
with him and handed one section to Janet and another to Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand that this company is comparatively small when you think
of the one used in the production of the picture?&#8221; he reminded them.
&#8220;It will be necessary for you to take several parts, but all of them will
be minor rôles since I understand neither of you have had any experience in
broadcasting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls nodded their understanding, and the director plunged on.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to give only the high spots of the film story over the
air, but in addition we are going to weave in some of the actual drama and the
thrills attached to the shooting of the picture&#x2014;some of the
behind-the-scenes incidents. Understand?&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>Again they
nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not been able to get all of this material that we desired and
Mr. Newsom has informed me that you have a fair ability at
writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was aimed at Janet and she replied promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I enjoy writing,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but the question of ability
hasn&#8217;t been very well determined yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you sold a script for film purposes only recently,&#8221; pressed
the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true, but I think it was more luck than anything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be that as it may, I&#8217;d like you to write some of the intimate and
unusual things that go on in the production of such a picture. Get in all of the
thrilling material possible. Get me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; replied Janet, recalling the vivid hours that had
marked the production work on &#8220;Kings of the Air&#8221; when the company
was out in the desert and she had been kidnaped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take the rest of the day off and try to get some of the material
into my hands tomorrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>morning. We&#8217;ll
have it whipped into shape by the studio continuity writers, for this program
goes on the air day after tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, Mr. Adolphi,&#8221; promised Janet, and the
director hurried away to give further instructions to others in the
company.</p>

<p>Helen looked at Janet admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly get yourself into all kinds of work,&#8221; she
smiled. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ll have to go back to the hotel room and pound away on
a rented typewriter while I go down and see a show in the Music
Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; begged Janet, who was anxious to see the
interior of the world&#8217;s largest theater. &#8220;Wait another day until I can
go with you. There&#8217;ll be plenty for you to see in New York beside the Music
Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Helen. &#8220;We&#8217;ll plan on that for
tomorrow afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they left the studio they bumped into a slender, dark-haired girl who was
hurrying in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clumsy fools,&#8221; Janet heard the other girl murmur as she went on
and Janet&#8217;s face flushed for it had been as much the other&#8217;s fault as their
own. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>They dropped
down to the street level in the elevator and Janet started back for the hotel
while Helen walked toward Fifth avenue to enjoy a window shopping tour along the
exclusive shops that had made the avenue famous throughout the world.

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top: 64px;'><i>Chapter Nineteen</i></p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>A MANUSCRIPT VANISHES</p>

<p>Janet went directly to their hotel and asked at the desk about renting a
typewriter. Arrangements were made to have one delivered at her room within half
an hour and she went to change into an older dress, something that wouldn&#8217;t be
hurt by wrinkles that were bound to come as she labored over the
typewriter.</p>

<p>The machine was delivered promptly and Janet used a supply of the hotel
stationary for her writing material. At first the idea of setting down intimate
little things about the filming of the picture had appeared easy, but now that
the task was before her, the words and ideas did not come freely.</p>

<p>Janet wondered if she dared to record the story of the sabotage when the
company was on desert location. She could imagine that it would make grand
material for broadcasting purposes and so she set resolutely about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>task. The worst
that could happen would be for Mr. Adolphi to reject it entirely. Janet finally
got started and once under way the flow of words came smoothly and her fingers
moved rapidly over the keyboard.</p>

<p>She worked steadily for more than an hour, got up, stretched, walked around
the room and returned to the writing. She wasn&#8217;t attempting to make it a
complete story, just giving the sequences as they had happened during the
filming of &#8220;Kings of the Air&#8221; and the mysterious events which had
taken place out on the desert. It was natural that Janet should hint that the
plotting was the work of another concern for it had been common talk in their
own company later that Premier Films, also producing an air story, had attempted
to keep their own film from a successful conclusion. But it had only been talk
for there was no definite proof.</p>

<p>Helen came hurrying in just as Janet finished her work.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it going?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;All through,&#8221; replied her companion. &#8220;Have a good
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grand. I never knew there could be so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>many beautiful
shops in such a small area. Come on now. I want to ride a subway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to change clothes,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind changing for a subway trip. We&#8217;ll go down to the Battery.
I inquired the way at the desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet slipped on a light brown coat and followed Helen down and across to the
Times Square subway station where they found themselves engulfed in the crowd
and the noise. Helen dropped two nickels in the turnstile and they went through
the gate, Helen still in the lead and striding along as though she were the
veteran of many a ride in the subway instead of a rank beginner.</p>

<p>A train roared out of the darkness of the tube and Janet saw a sign,
&#8220;South Ferry,&#8221; on the windows.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our train,&#8221; cried Helen, shoving her companion ahead of
her and into one of the seats. Other passengers piled in, the doors clanged and
they were roaring through the tunnel far under the street level. Their train was
an express and occasionally they shot past a slower local. The air was close
with an odor that is peculiar to a subway, but Janet enjoyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>the ride,
watching the crowd in the car. It was evident that most of them were accustomed
to using the subway several times a day and they were either visiting or reading
evening papers, which they had folded so they would take up the least possible
room.</p>

<p>At the South Ferry station they walked up to the street levels and entered
Battery park. Janet paused a moment, struck by the beauty of the harbor in the
late afternoon. Beyond the Battery was the Statue of Liberty and even further
the tidewater flats of Jersey.</p>

<p>Several freighters, which had cleared their docks a few minutes before, were
going down the harbor and Janet and Helen, standing along the Battery wondered
for what distant port they might be bound.</p>

<p>They walked past the Aquarium. On another afternoon they would come back and
spend several hours going through that fascinating building.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; confessed Janet. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get back to the
hotel now, clean up, and have dinner. Perhaps we&#8217;ll go to a show after
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen readily agreed to the suggestion and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>they returned to
the South Ferry station where they caught an uptown express that took them to
Times Square at a dizzy pace.</p>

<p>When they emerged from the tube, the shadows were lengthening in the heart of
the city. Sidewalks were crowded with hundreds of men and women on their way
home after a day&#8217;s work in the city. They paused for several minutes to watch
the teeming mass of humanity and then turned and entered their hotel.</p>

<p>Janet was the first to step into their rooms and the instant she passed the
threshold a feeling of foreboding gripped her and she stopped so suddenly that
Helen bumped into her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Helen, looking up quickly.</p>

<p>Janet looked a little sheepish. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. For some reason I
thought there was something wrong in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want me to scream?&#8221; smiled Helen. &#8220;I can do a good job of
that and I guarantee to get someone here in less than a minute with one
scream.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the banter Janet was far from reassured for a feeling of unrest
had settled <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>down
upon her. She snapped on the lights in the room and looked around.</p>

<p>Apparently nothing had been disturbed and Helen walked past her and went on
into her own room. A puff of wind stirred the curtains at the half-opened window
and Janet walked over and looked out. There was no fire escape nearby and it
would have been impossible for anyone to have gained access to their room in
that manner. But then, she asked herself, why would anyone want to enter their
room. They carried no personal jewelry of any value and the money they had left
in the room was of such a small amount that it would not make robbery worth
while.</p>

<p>In the next room Helen was humming to herself as she undressed and prepared
to take a shower. Janet dropped down on the bed to rest a moment. It had been a
hectic day and she was tired. Her eyes dropped and she fell into a deep
sleep.</p>

<p>Helen finished her shower, looked in at Janet, then returned to her own room,
where she partially dressed, put on a dressing gown, and sat down to write a
letter home chronicling the events of her first day in New York. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>Janet awoke
as suddenly as she had fallen asleep. Helen had turned out the light in her room
and it was quite dark now, the only light coming through the half-opened door
that led to the bathroom and on to Helen&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>Janet turned on the light over the desk where she had been writing and
glanced down at the manuscript she had been working on. She turned and called
sharply to Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you pick up the manuscript I finished this afternoon?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen it since we left for the Battery,&#8221; replied Helen.
&#8220;The last I knew it was right beside your typewriter. Maybe you&#8217;re too
sleepy to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not that sleepy,&#8221; retorted Janet.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had put it on the dresser and she turned toward that article of
furniture but there was no sign of the manuscript there. She pulled open the
drawers, but the manuscript was not there and Helen joined her in the
hunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure you haven&#8217;t taken it to your room and mislaid it?&#8221; asked
Janet, a deep pucker of worry lining her forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll look to make sure,&#8221; said Helen and they hastened to her
room, but the search
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>there was just
as fruitless as the one in Janet&#8217;s room. Janet even looked in the closets, but
there was no encouragement there. In a last hope, she went through the
wastepaper basket, but she was doomed to disappointment and turned to Helen, her
voice shaking with emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt about it now,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Someone
entered our rooms while we were away and stole the manuscript I had been working
on!&#8221; </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>THE MYSTERY DEEPENS</p>

<p>The girls stared helplessly at each other and Helen was finally the first to
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Janet, that can&#8217;t be possible. It must be here
somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet shook her head firmly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t here and we both know it. My
premonition when we entered the room was right. Something is decidedly
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can we do about it?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call the clerk,&#8221; said Janet, picking up the
telephone. She explained briefly what had happened. &#8220;The assistant manager
is here. He&#8217;s coming up in five minutes,&#8221; she said when she replaced the
instrument on the stand.</p>

<p>Helen rushed back to her own room to finish dressing and was fully clothed
when the assistant manager arrived. He made a careful examination of the door
and the lock and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>went all over
the rooms with the girls, but as Janet had felt convinced, there was no further
trace of the missing papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret this deeply,&#8221; said the hotel official, &#8220;and can
only promise that every effort will be made to see that the papers are returned
if they are still in the building.&#8221; He excused himself to question the
housekeeper about any maid who might have been working in the room while the
girls were away.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes he returned, a maid following close behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the mystery is solved,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The maid
says she came in to put fresh towels in the bathroom and someone knocked at the
door. She answered and a man from the World Broadcasting Company said he had
come to get your manuscript. He came right on in and picked up the papers beside
the typewriter. Of course she should not have admitted him, but he appeared to
know just what he wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he look like?&#8221; Janet asked the maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t pay particular attention, but he was small and I
guess you would call him dark. He had on a hat and it was pulled down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>over his
forehead. He took the papers and went on out. Said they&#8217;d be waiting for you
at the broadcasting office tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe this solves the mystery,&#8221; said the assistant
manager.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; agreed Janet. &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry to have caused
you so much trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the hotel official and the maid had taken their departure, Helen turned
to her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know the radio people were in such a hurry for the material
you were working on,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither did I,&#8221; replied Janet, &#8220;but I guess it is all
right. Let&#8217;s have dinner now and then perhaps a show. I feel tremendously
relieved about the manuscript.&#8221;</p>

<p>They added a dab of powder and a touch of rouge to their faces and went
downstairs. Further down the block they had noticed an attractive Old English
Inn and they walked there where they enjoyed a leisurely dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do now?&#8221; asked Helen as she finished the dish of
ice cream which was their dessert. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>&#8220;Shall
we go back to Radio City and see the Music Hall?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like nothing better. We&#8217;re on our way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They strolled along at a leisurely pace, turned into Sixth Avenue and headed
north toward the great mass of gray limestone which was Radio City. Overhead the
trains rumbled along the elevated, but Janet and Helen had eyes only for Radio
City.</p>

<p>Ahead of them opened the doors of the world&#8217;s largest theater and with
their hearts beating faster than usual they purchased their tickets and walked
into the grand foyer, the most majestic, breath-taking enclosure either of them
had ever been in. Their feet sank into the heavy pile of the great carpet and
their eyes feasted on the beauty of the towering bronze doors which led into the
theater itself.</p>

<p>Then they went on into the Music Hall, which with its sixty-two hundred
seats, was the largest of the world&#8217;s modern theaters. A great expanse of
space greeted their eyes, the theater sloping gently forward to the huge stage.
An orchestra, in full dress, was rising from the depths of its pit as though
lifted by <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>the
hand of some unseen giant. The orchestra broke into a full swell of music and
Janet and Helen, sinking into deep, comfortable seats, were enraptured. Above
them hidden lights changed the color effect of the ceiling continuously. Then
the overture was over and the curtains of the stage parted and for half an hour
they enjoyed a musical entertainment based on Coney Island, the famed fun center
of the city. After that came the feature picture, and they enjoyed every moment
of the nearly three hours of entertainment.</p>

<p>When it was over they walked out slowly, for the Music Hall was one great
part of Radio City. Tomorrow, across the street and up on the twenty-seventh
floor, they would be in another but very vital part of Radio City, in the
broadcasting studios of the World Broadcasting Company. As they walked down
Sixth Avenue they glanced aloft and far up in the building a blaze of light
shone from windows. Some company was busy up there tonight, providing thousands
of radio fans with drama or music for their entertainment and they thrilled at
the thought that within a very short time, they, too, would be a part of the
radio world. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>Back in their
rooms that night Janet glanced at the place beside the typewriter where the
manuscript had disappeared. She would have liked to have telephoned Curt Newsom
and told the lanky cowboy about the incident but he had not mentioned where he
was staying. She thought of telephoning Mr. Adolphi, their radio director, but
dismissed that for she felt that he might think her foolish. Undoubtedly he had
sent for the manuscript.</p>

<p>They were up early the next morning, refreshed after a night of sound sleep.
A quick shower was followed by a rapid but thorough toilet and they were ready
for what they might have in store for them. They had breakfast in the grill room
which opened off the main lobby of their hotel and then started for Radio
City.</p>

<p>There was a touch of fall in the air and they walked briskly, pushing through
other hurrying throngs of men and women who were on their way to work.</p>

<p>The elevator shot them up to the twenty-seventh floor in a dizzy, breathless
rush and they stepped out into the reception room. A page took them to studio K
and there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>only two others
there when they entered&#x2014;Ben Adolphi, their director, and Curt Newsom. The
cowboy star looked a little pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>Curt shook his head. &#8220;Not exactly, but I didn&#8217;t sleep very well last
night. Too much noise here in the city. I&#8217;m going to move. My hotel&#8217;s right
on Times Square.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;re staying there too,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;Our hotel is
the Dorchester. We slept fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m staying there,&#8221; replied Curt, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see how
you slept. I heard fire engines and police patrols and street cars and newsboys
all night. I might as well have been down in the subway trying to sleep on an
express train.&#8221;</p>

<p>The radio director looked at Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Manuscript ready?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Janet stared at him and he repeated the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; he snapped, evidently a little provoked at what
he considered dull wits.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the maid at the hotel said someone from the studio called
yesterday afternoon for it. It&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I didn&#8217;t send for it,&#8221; he retorted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>&#8220;Evidently
it was some one&#8217;s idea of a practical joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was much of a joke,&#8221; said Curt quietly.
&#8220;If the manuscript Janet was working on has disappeared, it vanished
because someone was afraid of what she might write.&#8221; </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>INSINUATIONS</p>

<p>At the cool words of the cowboy star, the radio director whirled to face
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean by that,&#8221; he demanded, his face
flushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean just this,&#8221; retorted Curt. &#8220;There was a very real
attempt made on the coast to stop the filming of &#8216;Kings of the Air&#8217;
and it begins to look like that attempt is being carried on even in New York in
an effort to stop the promotion of the picture. All I&#8217;ve got to say is that
someone had better be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you insinuating anything?&#8221; demanded the radio
director.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not insinuating; I&#8217;m just saying,&#8221; said the cowboy star
firmly.</p>

<p>The director turned back to Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure the manuscript was stolen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was unless someone in the studio here has it,&#8221; she replied.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll
make inquiries,&#8221; he promised, &#8220;but I am sure no one in the studio
would have sent for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Adolphi left studio K and Janet, Helen and Curt Newsom were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not kidding about the manuscript being missing?&#8221; Curt
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Curt, I&#8217;m terribly serious. We went out for a time yesterday
afternoon. While we were gone the maid came in to leave clean towels and while
she was in the room a man came in. He said he was from the studio here and had
come for the manuscript. Naturally the girl didn&#8217;t object and he walked out
with the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you have in the story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a lot about the final days in the desert. How the attempts were
made to stop the picture, the bombing from the sky and my own
kidnaping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hint that some other company was responsible for this?&#8221;
The question was snapped at Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, I did, but of course I didn&#8217;t mention any
company by name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt scratched his head in frank worry. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>&#8220;You
know,&#8221; he confessed, &#8220;this thing has got me puzzled. There is some
powerful agency at work to stop the picture Helen&#8217;s father made and I believe
its influence must extend right here into this studio. You girls be sure and
watch your step and especially at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But nothing will happen to us,&#8221; protested Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose there will, but you keep on the alert just the
same,&#8221; Curt warned them.</p>

<p>Mr. Adolphi returned and shook his head in response to Janet&#8217;s inquiring
gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve checked everyone in the studio,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and no
one knows anything about it. Can you do the manuscript over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; assented Janet, &#8220;but I&#8217;d prefer not to under
the circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The director did not insist and Janet thought perhaps he even seemed a little
relieved.</p>

<p>Other members of the company arrived. Several of them had been in the film
company on the coast but most of them were from the regular stock company which
the studio maintained for its dramatic needs. Most of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>were pleasant
enough. Only one of them turned Janet against her and that was the small,
dark-haired actress who had bumped into her the day before and called her a
&#8220;clumsy fool.&#8221; That was Rachel Nesbit and Janet thought her eyes a
trifle too close together and her mouth too hard. It looked as though it was
difficult for Rachel to look pleasant and there was a sulky twist to her
lips.</p>

<p>Janet soon found that Rachel was the pampered member of the studio&#8217;s stock
company. She was considered an actress of ability and she arrived late and left
early during rehearsals. Her one redeeming grace was that she came through when
she was before a microphone. Janet also learned that Rachel was writing in
addition to her acting and that she had had several of her skits produced on the
air.</p>

<p>As soon as the company was assembled, Director Adolphi plunged into the task
of rehearsing. Sound men brought in the necessary paraphernalia and through the
hours of the morning they went over the first scene which was to be presented in
their radio show. The program was to be unusual, running half an hour for five
consecutive nights, each of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>increasing the
tempo and mystery of the action. Janet, reading the script, could feel the thing
getting into her blood and she was anxious for the hour to come when they would
actually go on the air.</p>

<p>She had no fear of the microphone, now, for that had vanished while she was
working for Billy Fenstow in the westerns with Curt Newsom and Helen.</p>

<p>The trio had lunch together that noon, and returned immediately to the
studio, where rehearsals continued into the afternoon and at the close of the
day the director rather grudgingly conceded that the company had made excellent
progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be here tomorrow sharply at nine,&#8221; he cautioned as he dismissed
them for the day.</p>

<p>Members of the company scattered quickly, some of them hurrying away to catch
trains for their suburban homes.</p>

<p>Janet, Helen, and Curt Newsom walked slowly toward the elevators. The
corridor down which they walked was practically deserted for none of the studios
flanking it were in use. They entered the main lobby of the World Broadcasting
Company office. From
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>a loudspeaker on
the reception desk came the voice of a world-famous crooner which Helen
recognized instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a program I&#8217;d like to see,&#8221; she told Curt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, then. Now that we are members of a radio company, we ought to
be able to crash the gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cowboy star inquired the way to the proper studio and they turned and
walked down a long corridor to Studio A, the largest and most costly of all of
the broadcasting rooms of the World Company. It was like a little theater, with
sloping seats and a stage upon which the performers worked before the
microphone. At the back was a large orchestra, while up to the front of the
stage the famous crooner was singing into a &#8220;mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he doesn&#8217;t look at all like I thought he would,&#8221;
exclaimed Helen as they peered through the plate glass windows which flanked one
wall of the studio. &#8220;He&#8217;s much older.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of us are disillusioned about our heroes and heroines,&#8221;
said Curt quietly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s eat. I&#8217;d like a steak.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>&#8220;Sounds
good to me,&#8221; agreed Janet, and even Helen was willing to leave the studio
after another minute or two of gazing at the crooner.</p>

<p>They ate in a small but attractive restaurant off Sixth Avenue and after a
leisurely meal Curt hurried away to keep an appointment and Janet and Helen,
though tired from the long day&#8217;s grind of rehearsals, strolled over to Fifth
Avenue to look into shop windows. After half an hour on the avenue, they started
back to their Times Square hotel, heading west on one of New York&#8217;s dark and
little-frequented cross streets.</p>

<p>They were halfway down the long, dimly lit block when Helen seized Janet&#8217;s
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone&#8217;s following us!&#8221; she whispered.</p>

</div>

<div>
<a id='ref_av'></a>
<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top: 64px;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span><i>Chapter Twenty-two</i></p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>SHADOWED!</p>

<p>Despite Helen&#8217;s whisper of warning, Janet never missed a stride. If
anything, she quickened her pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep up with me,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and don&#8217;t look
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>From somewhere behind Janet could hear steady footfalls that quickened as
they walked faster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure someone is following us?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Positive,&#8221; replied Helen. &#8220;There was someone back of us on
the avenue and he turned onto this street right after we did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it must be coincidence,&#8221; insisted Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;But remember what Curt said about our knowing too much of the
mysterious events that went on during the last days of the filming of
&#8216;Kings of the Air,&#8217;&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;He warned us to watch
out.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>There was no
answer to that for Curt had warned them and Janet was glad that they were near
the bright lights of Broadway. She felt safer now. As the noise of that great
artery of traffic deepened, they slowed their pace and Janet turned and looked
around.</p>

<p>There was no one on the street behind them. She grasped Helen&#8217;s arm and
both girls stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one following us,&#8221; smiled Janet. &#8220;It was just
imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t imagination and you know it,&#8221; declared Helen.
&#8220;Whoever it was could easily have slipped into a doorway. Maybe he&#8217;s
watching us this very moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet felt a shiver of nervousness race along her spine. It was not pleasant
to think of being shadowed, especially in New York where there were so many
people and so few friends.</p>

<p>They turned into Times Square and entered the lobby of their hotel. At the
desk they inquired for mail and each received letters from home.</p>

<p>Once up in the privacy of their rooms, they undressed, slipped into
comfortable pajamas and dressing gowns, and read their letters. There was little
actual news from Clarion, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>just hearing
from their fathers and mothers was nice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad is anxious to hear the first part of the program,&#8221; said
Helen as she finished her letter. &#8220;He says they&#8217;ll all be over at our
house grouped around the radio when we go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nervous about it?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not particularly about the program, but there&#8217;s something about the
whole thing that has me uncertain. The company seems to be on edge as though
there was some danger hanging over the heads of everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps talk about the trouble on the coast has reached them,&#8221;
suggested Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be. But I&#8217;m so anxious for the program to be a success.
This picture has meant so much to Dad; it&#8217;s the air epic that he has wanted to
do for years. If it goes over in a big way, the Ace Company will renew his
contract for a substantial time and give him a big increase in
salary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly after that they retired and both girls slept soundly.</p>

<p>Next day at the studio the pressure was on again and Director Adolphi whipped
them through the rehearsals at a terrific pace. Several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>changes in
script were necessary and the director sent a page to the scenario department on
the run. He returned in a few minutes with Jim Hill, the writer who had handled
the continuity for the radio play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Jim,&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;This sequence is punk. It will
fall flat on the air and too much money is being spent on this program. Get some
punch into this or I&#8217;ll see that another writer gets the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim Hill was tall, lean and pleasant, with dark eyes that shot back sparks at
the director&#8217;s criticism.</p>

<p>&#8220;You okayed this script once,&#8221; he reminded Adolphi, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll see what I can do about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dark, pretty Rachel Nesbit stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty good at that sort of thing,&#8221; she declared, flashing
a winning smile at Jim Hill. &#8220;Perhaps I could help on the
rewriting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The continuity writer looked at her glumly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your stuff is all right for lighter things, but this is straight
action drama,&#8221; he said shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can at least try,&#8221; insisted Rachel, and the worried
continuity writer finally acceded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>to her insistent
requests. He left the studio with Rachel accompanying him.</p>

<p>Janet turned to Curt Newsom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought all of the work on this script was being handled with the
utmost precaution and that no one outside was to do anything on
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right, but Rachel can hardly be called an outsider
since she belongs to the studio&#8217;s stock company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she sells some of her radio skits free lance,&#8221; insisted
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Curt. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hastened over to Director Adolphi.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one with any outside contacts is supposed to work on this script or
in the company,&#8221; he told the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; replied Mr. Adolphi. &#8220;There&#8217;s an
iron-clad contract with the Ace Motion Picture Corporation to that
effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better get Rachel back here. She&#8217;ll read the rest of
the script and know what the final broadcast will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but Rachel&#8217;s all right. Of course she does a little free lance
stuff, but she can be depended upon.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m
not arguing that point,&#8221; said Curt firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;m just telling you
to get Rachel back here unless you want a violation of your contract reported to
the Ace Company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d stoop to such a dirty trick,&#8221; sneered
the radio director.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t even need to think,&#8221; snapped Curt, his eyes
flashing. &#8220;You just live up to the agreements of that contract and
you&#8217;ll have no more trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>With his temper considerably ruffled, Mr. Adolphi left the studio and other
members of the company stared wide-eyed at the husky cowboy star for most of
them held their director in awe, but Curt had spoken firmly and there had been
nothing else for Adolphi to do unless he violated the contract.</p>

<p>He returned to the studio in less than five minutes with Rachel Nesbit at his
heels. The minute she entered the room, she rushed toward Janet, her hands
clenched and her eyes snapping sparks of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re responsible for this insult,&#8221; she stormed at Janet.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to step on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, calm down, Rachel,&#8221; said the director.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>&#8220;It was
this skinny cowboy who started the trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>The radio actress and continuity writer whirled toward Curt Newsom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead and step on me,&#8221; he grinned, and a titter of giggles
ran through the rest of the company.</p>

<p>Rachel&#8217;s dark cheeks flamed anew with anger, but she kept her tongue and
turned away in silence.</p>

<p>The rehearsal continued. They were getting well along in the production and
Janet felt that it was going smoothly. It was a condensed version of the real
story of &#8220;Kings of the Air&#8221; and so to Janet and Helen it was
familiar material.</p>

<p>Promptly at noon the director stopped the rehearsal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Half an hour for lunch,&#8221; he announced and the company scattered
at once.</p>

<p>Janet and Helen walked down the long corridor to the reception room where a
hurrying figure almost bumped into them.</p>

<p>It was Jim Hill, the continuity writer. He stopped suddenly and his face
lighted up as he recognized them. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>&#8220;Just
the girls I&#8217;m looking for!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Lunch
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then have lunch with me,&#8221; and before they could remonstrate, he
hurried them toward the elevator and they dropped downward with a suddenness
that always unnerved Janet. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>JANET PINCH HITS</p>

<p>Janet and Helen found that Jim Hill was extremely pleasant and likeable, but
he appeared to be laboring under some severe nervous strain and Janet noticed
that his hands shook when he picked up a glass of milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;This script for your broadcast has about got me down,&#8221; he
confessed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to keep lots of punch in the action and yet I
can&#8217;t give away the actual plot of the film. On top of that old Adolphi is a
regular crab and it doesn&#8217;t seem like anything will suit him. This whole show
of yours has to be okayed Saturday night by the Ace film people and if they
don&#8217;t like it they can cancel out and give it to another
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any danger of that?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say there is. This is a juicy contract and two other chains
would like to get it on their networks. Believe me, there is some intense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>rivalry in
getting big contracts like this. Why the Acme and the Sky High chains would be
willing to pay a large sum just to see us fizzle the rehearsal Saturday
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet was silent for a time. She had sensed the tension in the studio without
knowing exactly what was behind it. Now she knew what was wrong.</p>

<p>Jim Hill was speaking again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of you girls are from the original film company on the coast,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Helen nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you would have some suggestions that might help me out of
this tangle,&#8221; suggested the continuity writer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Adolphi suggested that several days ago and I worked one whole
afternoon on it, but someone stole the manuscript I had finished out of my
room,&#8221; explained Janet.</p>

<p>Jim whistled softly to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how it stands.&#8221; Janet and Helen weren&#8217;t sure
whether he was talking to them or to himself.</p>

<p>The continuity writer pushed back his chair and stared at them
appraisingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d help me and I&#8217;ll promise that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>your script
won&#8217;t be stolen from your hotel room. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet looked at Helen, and her companion nodded approvingly. The decision was
easy to make for Jim was likeable and both of the girls wanted the broadcast to
be a success.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; Helen corrected her. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
good as a writer and you can fairly make a typewriter talk. I&#8217;ll just hang
around and give you whatever advice I can and try not to be a
nuisance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s great,&#8221; said the continuity writer. &#8220;When
can you begin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as we are through rehearsing this afternoon,&#8221; promised
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will it take?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;Radio continuity is
something new for me. I&#8217;ll simply do the rough stuff and you&#8217;ll have to
smooth it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then suppose you come to my office as soon as you&#8217;re through and you
can work right on into the evening. Helen and I will see that you are well
supplied with coffee, sandwiches and whatever you want in the way of
eats.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll
be there,&#8221; promised Janet. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ve got to get back to the
studio.&#8221;</p>

<p>At rehearsal that afternoon neither their director nor Rachel Nesbit were in
a good mood and Rachel made it obvious that despite Curt&#8217;s explanation she
still blamed Janet and Helen for being taken off the continuity work on the
script.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the chance of a lifetime,&#8221; Janet overheard her telling
another girl in the company. &#8220;What if there is a clause about keeping the
script secret. I&#8217;d know it as soon as the final chapter is placed in the hands
of the company for rehearsal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we won&#8217;t get the final chapter until Saturday afternoon,&#8221;
replied the other. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking no chances about any leaks on this
program so any of the other companies can interfere with their contract for this
big film broadcast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet had no idea just how much the broadcast of their program would mean to
the World Broadcasting Company, but from all the talk in the studio, she knew
that it must be an exceedingly large sum. The vice president in charge of
programs dropped into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>studio that
afternoon and watched them work for over an hour. At the end of that time, when
the director called a brief recess, Janet saw him conferring with Mr. Adolphi.
Whatever passed between them evidently was not pleasant to the director for he
called them back at once and they started all over again, the director driving
them with an intensity that approached a white-hot fury.</p>

<p>At last the rehearsal was over and most of them were completely worn out.
Janet, fortunately, had been spared most of the director&#8217;s criticism while
poor Helen had come in for several bitter attacks from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going on to the hotel, take a shower and crawl into bed,&#8221;
said Helen. &#8220;Another day like this will put me in bed for a
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be along later,&#8221; said Janet. &#8220;Get the mail at the
desk and if there are any letters for me, leave them on my bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>They parted, Helen taking the elevator down and Janet turning toward the
suite of rooms where the continuity writers worked. At the end of a long
corridor, she found Jim Hill&#8217;s office, a tiny cubby that contained only a
desk, chair and typewriter stand. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>&#8220;I
thought you&#8217;d forgotten all about this writing date,&#8221; said Jim, looking
up. &#8220;I&#8217;ve patched up the sequence that Adolphi objected to this
afternoon, but I&#8217;m still in a mess over the last episode. It&#8217;s got to carry
a lot of punch and this is the chapter we&#8217;ve got to guard until the last
afternoon of rehearsal. There are more leaks in a big studio like this than you
can shake a fist at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who would give away this information?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not hard to guess,&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;It could be
someone jealous of another member of the company, or someone who wanted a job
with another broadcasting outfit and who figured that by double crossing his or
her present employer, a better job could be obtained.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim stood up and motioned for Janet to take his place at the typewriter.
Briefly he explained what he had been trying to work out and Janet thought his
ideas sounded good. But somewhere the winning punch was lacking.</p>

<p>She scanned the last pages of script which he had written. Then she rolled a
fresh sheet of copy paper into the typewriter and started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>work. A new
interest took possession of her and the fatigue of the day dropped away as she
got into the swing of the writing. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>NIGHT ON THE TWENTY-SEVENTH FLOOR</p>

<p>Jim Hill peered over her shoulder for a time. Then satisfied at the work she
was doing, he slipped away and went in quest of a basket of lunch. It was nearly
half an hour before he returned and by that time Janet had completed two pages
of manuscript.</p>

<p>Jim laid the lunch out on his desk and while Janet munched a thick, cold meat
sandwich and quaffed a glass of cold milk, he read the pages with real
care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, this is just the stuff my script lacked,&#8221; enthused the
continuity writer. &#8220;My gosh, Janet, you ought to be on the staff here. We
pay money for fresh ideas like these.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet stopped munching the sandwich and looked at Jim Hill with real
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You actually think it is good?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s good. Of course a lot of work has to be done to put
it in finished form, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>you&#8217;ve got the
meat of it here. I&#8217;m going to take this down to McGregor. He&#8217;s still in his
office.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Janet could ask about McGregor and who he was, Jim Hill picked up the
manuscript and his own work and fled down the hall.</p>

<p>When he returned ten minutes later a square hulk of a man, who had thick
pompadour hair and peered through thick lensed glasses, followed him into his
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janet,&#8221; said the younger writer, &#8220;I want you to know Mr.
McGregor, who is head of our continuity department. I showed him your manuscript
and he agrees with me that it is just what we want for the final episode in the
program for Ace Pictures. Can you go on working tonight? We&#8217;ve got to have the
finished draft in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a dire appeal in young Jim Hill&#8217;s eyes. Janet couldn&#8217;t have
ignored that and then Mr. McGregor spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is extremely important that we have the Ace contract,&#8221; he
said in his slow, precise way. &#8220;Other companies are also anxious for it
and if our dress rehearsal Saturday night fails to meet the approval of the Ace
officials, we may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>lose the
contract, which would then go to one of our rivals. We are none too sure but
what they have certain people within our own staff who might sell them some of
our secrets about this program.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the situation,&#8221; said Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired, but
I&#8217;ll keep on until I either go to sleep or am through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor smiled approvingly and Jim Hill felt like shouting.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s splendid,&#8221; said the continuity chief. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to send Jim along to bed. He&#8217;s to report here early tomorrow morning to
start the rewriting of your story. You keep on as long as you can. When you are
through you can lock the script in the right hand drawer of Jim&#8217;s desk. Here
is a key for you and Jim has one already.&#8221;</p>

<p>The head of the continuity department departed and Jim Hill lingered on for a
minute or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Want some more lunch?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Janet, who had turned back to her typewriter, shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about a cup of coffee to keep you awake a while longer? I don&#8217;t
want you to go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>to sleep before
you get this material hashed out for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, Jim. I&#8217;ll get along all right. It won&#8217;t take long now if
I&#8217;m not interrupted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim Hill took the hint and departed quietly and Janet continued with her
work. It was something she thoroughly enjoyed doing. This writing was creating
something out of whole cloth. Of course it would have to have a special revision
by Jim tomorrow to work it into the script, but when it finally went on the air
there would still be a lot of her material in the radio play.</p>

<p>Janet worked for more than half an hour and then leaned back in her chair for
her arms ached and her eyes were blurred.</p>

<p>The studio was strangely silent. From somewhere at a distance came the soft
strains of an orchestra but there was no sound in the corridor where the
writer&#8217;s offices were located.</p>

<p>Janet picked up the sheets of copy she had written and scanned the material.
She smiled a bit as she read it and admitted that it did real well.</p>

<p>Placing the sheets back on the desk, she inserted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>a fresh page of
copy paper into the typewriter. She would be through in a few more minutes. She
glanced at her wrist watch before she started in again. It was eleven-forty. By
midnight she would be through.</p>

<p>Janet was about to resume her work when a queer sensation started at the base
of her spine and shot up her back. It was a feeling she couldn&#8217;t quite
describe and she sat perfectly motionless for several seconds.</p>

<p>Through her mind shot the thought that someone was watching her, peering at
her from the darkness of the long corridor.</p>

<p>Janet turned suddenly, but there was no one behind her. She got up and went
to the door where she could look down the corridor, but there was no one in
sight. The office across the corridor from Jim&#8217;s was dark and the windows only
mirrored the shadowy depths.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that she saw no one, Janet was not wholly reassured and she
looked about Jim&#8217;s office. There were shades at the windows and the door which
could be pulled down and she closed the door and drew all of the curtains.
Before returning to the desk, she snapped the spring lock on the door. That
done, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>she went
back to the typewriter, but it was hard to concentrate now.</p>

<p>Janet forced herself to the task. She knew she must finish and at last got
into the mood of her script again, working now at high speed and wholly
forgetful of the strange feeling which had alarmed her.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the distance a bell tolled midnight as she finished the last
page and pulled it triumphantly from the typewriter. The job was done and she
felt that it was well done.</p>

<p>The pages she had written were scattered over the top of the desk and as she
reached out to pick them up, one of them floated to the floor. Janet half turned
to pick it up. As she did so, her eyes fell on a small gap in the curtains she
had drawn on the windows along the corridor. </p>

</div>

<div>
<a id='ref_ay'></a>
<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top: 64px;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span><i>Chapter Twenty-five</i></p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>JANET OPENS A DOOR</p>

<p>A half stifled scream escaped from her lips. Someone was staring at her
intently through the small opening. The light from the desk lamp was just strong
enough to reveal two eyes. That was all, but Janet saw the desperate intentness
with which they were focused upon her.</p>

<p>Then the eyes vanished and there was no sound from the corridor.
Involuntarily Janet leaped to her feet, her trembling hands seeking the curtain
and closing the gap. She wanted to cry out, but the words stuck in her throat
and she realized that to scream would be useless for there was no one along the
corridor at this hour of the night who could help her.</p>

<p>Stepping back from the curtained window, Janet listened intently for the
sound of footfalls in the corridor. Then she remembered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>that it was
heavily carpeted and one could move along it without making a noise.</p>

<p>Visibly shaken, she finally rallied her nerves and stooped down to pick up
the sheet of copy which had fallen from the desk. Almost mechanically she placed
the sheets in order and stacked them neatly. That done she sat down at the desk
to decide what to do.</p>

<p>There was no question in her own mind but what someone was after the
manuscript she had finished and someone outside the studio. The disappearance of
the manuscript from her hotel room tied up with this latest event and Janet knew
that some agency was determined that the story of the last eventful days of the
filming of &#8220;Kings of the Air&#8221; should never be told as a part of the
radio play they were to present. Whether the unknown force was the Premier Film
Company or a radio rival of the World Broadcasting Company, she couldn&#8217;t even
guess, but in either case she knew that she was in a particularly unpleasant
position, and wished that Jim was with her.</p>

<p>Janet unlocked the right hand drawer of Jim&#8217;s desk and pulled it out. For
ordinary purposes it was strong enough, but to place a valuable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>manuscript in it
was something that made her hesitate.</p>

<p>She turned around and stared at the curtains at the windows and the door
along the corridor. They were drawn tightly now. It would be impossible for
anyone to see in the office.</p>

<p>What should she do with the manuscript? Would it be safe in her own hands
when she walked down the long corridor she must traverse before she reached the
reception lobby and the battery of elevators?</p>

<p>Janet didn&#8217;t feel she wanted to risk that, yet she knew it would be unsafe
in the drawer of Jim&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p>Suddenly her gaze fell upon the telephone and she smiled a little foolishly.
She picked up the instrument and waited for the operator in the main office to
answer.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>Janet jiggled the hook several times, but still there was no answer. She did
not know that the particular branch exchange on that floor which served the
publicity department did not have an operator on duty after midnight. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>Janet&#8217;s
spirits drooped when she failed to get a response through the telephone and once
more she looked about the room for some place to hide the manuscript.</p>

<p>Suddenly she hit upon a plan of action. Seizing the manuscript she hastened
over near the outside window, reached down and pulled up the heavy carpet which
covered the floor. Working swiftly she placed the manuscript under the carpet,
spreading the sheets out so there would be no noticeable bulge in the floor
covering.</p>

<p>That done Janet returned to the desk, picked up a handful of blank copy
paper, folded it quickly, and stuffed it into a large envelope. Taking up a pen
she scrawled these words on the envelope: &#8220;Jim Hill&#x2014;Here is the
manuscript you wanted. Hope it is something that will fit into your program.
Janet Hardy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet didn&#8217;t even stop to blot the wet ink, dropping the envelope into the
drawer, and closing and locking the receptacle.</p>

<p>She felt better after that. At least she felt she had done her best to save
the manuscript. Now the problem was to get up enough courage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>to attempt the
walk down the long, darkened corridor.</p>

<p>Janet slipped the key to the drawer of Jim&#8217;s desk into her left shoe,
mechanically patted her hair, and decided that she might just as well be on her
way.</p>

<p>It took nerve to open that door, and to step out into the hall from which
someone had been staring at her only several minutes before. But somehow Janet
managed it. </p>

</div>

<div>
<a id='ref_az'></a>
<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top: 64px;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span><i>Chapter Twenty-six</i></p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>IN THE HALL</p>

<p>From a distance came the soft strains of an orchestra playing in one of the
more distant studios on the same floor, but there was no movement in the
corridor.</p>

<p>Janet paused at the door. Should she snap out the lights? If no one came
along they would burn all night, yet if she turned them off, she would be in
utter darkness.</p>

<p>Then she realized that she was silhouetted in the light. Anyone who might
trouble her would be even more handicapped than she in the darkness and her
fingers pressed the switch.</p>

<p>As the lights went out, Janet stepped quickly away from the door, her feet
treading silently on the heavy carpet which covered the floor of the
hall.</p>

<p>Janet pressed close against the wall, listening for some sound which would
indicate that someone was lurking in the corridor. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>was only the far
away music of the orchestra as it played a dreamy waltz. From outside a clock
boomed, but Janet couldn&#8217;t remember whether it was a half after midnight or a
quarter to one. It didn&#8217;t matter much, she decided.</p>

<p>Convinced at last there was no one moving along the corridor, she started
feeling her own way along. The end of the corridor was marked by a very dim
light that failed to penetrate more than a dozen feet in any direction. It was
toward this glow that Janet started.</p>

<p>It was a ghostly and unnerving business, but she couldn&#8217;t spend the whole
night in Jim&#8217;s office. It just wasn&#8217;t possible. She had to get out.</p>

<p>Fighting to keep down a mounting fear, Janet quickened her steps. Then she
stopped abruptly. Just why she did that, she would never know, but her instinct
warned her that someone was near.</p>

<p>She turned toward an office door she had just passed. It was open and a flood
of light poured out to blind Janet&#8217;s tired eyes. The beam from the electric
torch was so bright it fairly seared its way into her fatigued mind.</p>

<p>Then the stabbing light vanished and Janet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>heard a swift
movement. A hard hand was clapped over her mouth and she felt an arm slide
around her neck.</p>

<p>Before she could scream or move, a soft cloth, which reminded her of a
hospital, was slapped against her face and the fumes of ether penetrated her
nose and throat. Janet attempted to struggle but two capable arms held her
fast.</p>

<p>She felt herself losing consciousness. She felt delightfully tired and
dreamy. Once she rallied her senses, but the next time she slipped away into
unconsciousness and her captor, satisfied that she would cause no trouble for
some time, let her fall into a heap on the floor.</p>

<p>While Janet remained unconscious, a lithe figure darted into Jim Hill&#8217;s
office and the flash sought the drawer into which she had dropped the
manuscript.</p>

<p>A small steel instrument, expertly inserted, forced the drawer open and the
beam of light fell upon the inscription Janet had placed on the envelope. The
intruder&#8217;s breath was drawn in sharply and it was evident that this was the
property sought.</p>

<p>Removing the envelope and placing it in his pocket, the unknown closed the
drawer and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>slipped out into
the corridor. Bending down over Janet, the figure vanished. Someone watching
closely could have seen it dodge into the main reception room, but there was no
one there to watch&#x2014;only Janet unconscious on the floor.</p>

<p>Just how long she remained slumped on the floor she would never know exactly;
probably it was not more than half an hour at the most.</p>

<p>Finally lights penetrated her tired mind and the sweetish smell of the ether
assailed her returning consciousness. Someone was shaking her gently and someone
else was rubbing her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, Janet, wake up!&#8221; a voice kept repeating.</p>

<p>It sounded strangely like Helen&#8217;s voice, but Helen, she realized, had gone
home hours before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a drink of this,&#8221; another voice commanded and Janet obeyed
almost automatically for she was far from being in full command of her
senses.</p>

<p>The cool water, flowing down her aching throat, helped and she tried to sit
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; a voice cautioned and she let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>her head drop
back against someone&#8217;s knees.</p>

<p>Lights were on now in the corridor and as consciousness returned Janet
recognized Helen leaning over her. Curt Newsom was massaging her arms and
grumbling to himself in anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feeling better?&#8221; Helen asked as Janet&#8217;s eyes opened
wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be all right, soon. I&#8217;d like another drink of water,&#8221;
said Janet.</p>

<p>A second glass of water followed the first and she felt stronger as her head
cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; said Curt. &#8220;We found
you unconscious on the floor a few minutes ago and the place smelled like a
hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at Jim Hill&#8217;s desk and see if the right hand drawer has
anything in it,&#8221; Janet whispered to Curt and the tall cowboy hurried away
to do her bidding.</p>

<p>He returned almost instantly, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone&#8217;s pried the drawer open with a jimmy,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a thing in the drawer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen looked stricken. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me that manuscript you worked on all evening was in that drawer,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Janet looked beyond Helen and Curt to where half a dozen studio employees,
most of them from the engineering department, were clustered looking at her and
wondering what it was all about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put the manuscript there just before I started down the hall,&#8221;
nodded Janet. &#8220;It looks like it&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a flicker of her right eyelid, barely visible to Helen and Curt,
and they caught its meaning and played the parts Janet wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that means they won&#8217;t be able to bolster up the program for Ace
Pictures,&#8221; wailed Helen. &#8220;The World Broadcasting Company will
probably lose its contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, and we&#8217;ll all lose our jobs,&#8221; groaned Curt. &#8220;Well,
there&#8217;s nothing we can do about it now. We might as well go back to the hotel.
We&#8217;ll report to Director Adolphi in the morning. Think you can walk if I
steady you?&#8221; The question was aimed at Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it all right,&#8221; she said, but the steadying influence
of Curt&#8217;s arm was welcome,</p>

<p>They walked down the corridor, across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>reception lobby,
and then sped downward in an elevator.</p>

<p>When they were outside and comfortably ensconced in a taxi, Helen faced her
companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the manuscript safe?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless Radio City burns down,&#8221; replied Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for goodness sake, where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I slipped it under the rug in Jim&#8217;s office and spread the sheets out
so there won&#8217;t be a hump which would attract attention. I&#8217;ll have to get up
early and phone him at the studio for he&#8217;s coming down to start the revision
of my material.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do no such thing,&#8221; cut in the cowboy. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
earned a morning of sleep. I&#8217;ll phone Jim Hill myself and explain where the
manuscript is hidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I want to know just what happened.&#8221; It was Helen
speaking.</p>

<p>Janet shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I knew someone was prowling in the corridor, but I
couldn&#8217;t stay there in the office all night and I couldn&#8217;t get a phone
connection out. After I&#8217;d hidden the manuscript I turned out the light in the
office and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>started down the
hall. Someone turned a flashlight into my face, then I was grabbed around the
neck and finally a cloth filled with ether was smashed against my face. About
that time I forgot to remember and the next thing I knew you two were with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many jumped on you?&#8221; asked the cowboy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be sure, but I&#8217;d say that it was one man who was capable
of moving very rapidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One man could do it all right,&#8221; nodded Curt. &#8220;I wish I
could get my hands on him and I&#8217;d teach him a thing or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you two happen to get into the corridor? That&#8217;s a question
I&#8217;d like to have answered,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I became worried when you didn&#8217;t get back to the hotel at midnight
and I phoned Curt. He agreed to meet me at Radio City and we came up together.
It was as simple as that,&#8221; explained Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for once I&#8217;m glad someone worried about me,&#8221; confessed
Janet. &#8220;And, oh what a headache that ether gave me. The water tasted good,
but I feel queer inside now. Bed is going to seem like heaven.&#8221; </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>SUSPICIONS</p>

<p>When she was alone in her room, Janet fairly tumbled into bed but not until
she had picked up a letter Helen had brought up from the desk and placed on the
bedside table. When she was stretched out comfortably in bed, Janet opened the
letter. It was from home, her mother telling of news of the neighborhood and of
interesting little things about the house.</p>

<p>Janet finished the letter, tucked it under her pillow, and snapped out the
light. She was glad that her mother did not know of the stirring events of that
night.</p>

<p>Janet slept late the next morning, for her fatigue had been heavier than she
had imagined. After an invigorating shower, she returned to her own room and
there found a note propped on the writing table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have gone on to Radio City,&#8221; wrote Helen. &#8220;Will meet you
there for lunch if you&#8217;re awake.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>Janet
partially dressed and pulled on her dressing gown. Then she called the World
Broadcasting Company and got a connection with Jim Hill&#8217;s office. The young
continuity writer answered at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Janet Hardy. I just wanted to know if you were able to dig the
copy out from under your carpet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say I was,&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;It&#8217;s good stuff, Janet.
Say, what under the sun went on here last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to really know,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the studio officials are all upset about it. They were worried
enough trying to land the big contract with the Ace Motion Picture Corporation
and now they fairly have the jitters. The studio is being gone over with a
fine-toothed comb to see if some clue can be unearthed. Have you thought of
anything that would help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, I&#8217;ve just gotten up and I don&#8217;t think well
without any breakfast,&#8221; confessed Janet. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll have an idea
or two by the time I reach the studio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost time for lunch,&#8221; Jim reminded her. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m
to meet Helen for lunch at the studio,&#8221; replied Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then count me in on that and maybe we can get a line on who this was
chasing around the studio last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet completed dressing and started for the studio. The morning was clear
and cool and it seemed impossible now that such events could have happened the
night before in the studio. She swung into Sixth Avenue, walking briskly, and
headed for Radio City.</p>

<p>When Janet arrived at the studio, the rehearsal in studio K was at an end for
the morning and members of the company were hurrying out for lunch. Rachel
Nesbit, her dark eyes flashing, pushed past Janet with little ceremony and Janet
thought that the director looked away and flushed. But then, she might have been
imagining that for Director Adolphi and Rachel were known to be close
friends.</p>

<p>Helen came hurrying up, followed by Curt Newsom.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you feeling now?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hungry,&#8221; confessed Janet. &#8220;What&#8217;s the news around the
studio?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, everybody is looking at everybody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>else and
wondering who did it. They all seem to think it was an inside job for outsiders
couldn&#8217;t have known that you were working on that script, much less where you
were working. I guess suspicion centers pretty strongly right on this
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would mean someone in our own unit has sold out to a rival
company and is doing everything in their power to keep this broadcast from being
a success,&#8221; mused Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s putting it politely,&#8221; put in Curt. &#8220;I&#8217;d say
that someone is a skunk, and I hate skunks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim Hill joined them just then. He looked tired and worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s eat,&#8221; he said, and the others agreed, the group
adjourning to a nearby restaurant. They obtained a secluded table where they
could talk with little risk of being overheard by prying ears.</p>

<p>After giving their orders, Jim turned to Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been able to think up any clues?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to think of every event that took place, but I can&#8217;t
remember any special smell,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>or noise, and I
didn&#8217;t even feel the garments of my assailant. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m of no
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; conceded Jim, running his fingers through his
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you found out, Curt?&#8221;</p>

<p>The cowboy star likewise had nothing to contribute.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got plenty of suspicions, but not a grain of proof,&#8221; he
grumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. We all have suspicions but no proof and this program
must be in dress rehearsal tomorrow night and there can&#8217;t be any boners pulled
then. We&#8217;ve simply got to solve this mystery before then. Until this is
cleared up the script won&#8217;t be safe for a minute unless someone is with it all
of the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it now?&#8221; demanded Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my office with the door locked and an office boy standing guard in
front of the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound very safe to me. Suppose someone well known
should come along and send the boy on an errand. He&#8217;d leave the door and there
your manuscript would be unprotected.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>&#8220;Oh,
it&#8217;s safe enough,&#8221; smiled Jim. Then he paused suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, maybe you&#8217;re right. That could happen, especially if one of the
program directors or other officials happened along. I told the boy to be sure
and stay on the job, but he&#8217;d run an errand for any one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead with your lunches. I&#8217;ll skip up and get the script and
rejoin you. It won&#8217;t take five minutes.&#8221; </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>REHEARSALS AGAIN</p>

<p>Jim Hill hastened away, but it was fifteen minutes before he returned with a
large envelope with the manuscript. When he arrived his face was flushed and he
was breathing rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Helen, who sensed that Jim was
greatly upset.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty. It was a good thing I got there when I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean someone was after the manuscript?&#8221; demanded
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean someone had it,&#8221; retorted Jim. &#8220;But I got it back
and without much trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was in your office?&#8221; It was Curt who fired that
question.</p>

<p>Jim looked at them steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Adolphi.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited for the significance of his words to sink in and smiled a little
grimly at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>bewilderment
which was reflected on their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surprised? Say, maybe you think I wasn&#8217;t. And now I don&#8217;t know
what to think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us everything that happened after you reached the studio
floor,&#8221; urged Janet.</p>

<p>Jim took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead, where glistening beads
of perspiration had gathered.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I swung down the corridor I saw the boy had left my door so I ran
the rest of the way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The carpet&#8217;s thick and I made
little if any noise. The door of my office was open and Adolphi was thumbing
through the pile of script I had been working on. When I came up behind him he
jumped almost across the desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Said he&#8217;d found the door of my office open and since he knew I was
working on the script thought he would look it over while I was out at
lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221; It was Curt speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I picked up the script, stuffed it into an envelope, and told Adolphi
he could see it when McGregor, my continuity chief, put his okay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>on it. I asked
Adolphi if he was sure my office was open and he got sore. Wanted to know what I
was trying to insinuate and all that sort of thing. But I think he felt guilty
as thunder. Gosh, but I&#8217;d like to know how he got in there after all my
precautions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you,&#8221; said Curt. &#8220;He simply walked down the
hall, told the boy to go on an errand, and then used a skeleton key on your
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been as easy as that,&#8221; protested
Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things like that are done easily,&#8221; smiled Curt. &#8220;Mark my
words, you watch our director closely. He isn&#8217;t putting his best foot forward
in getting us in shape. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he has sold out to some
other company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a terrible thing to say about anyone,&#8221; said
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse to do it,&#8221; Curt insisted.</p>

<p>They finished their lunch and returned to Radio City where they were whisked
up to the twenty-seventh floor in one of the express elevators.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop in after the rehearsal this afternoon,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>Jim told them.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the final script in shape by then.&#8221;</p>

<p>The afternoon was a fatiguing one, for Adolphi, as though possessed of a
demon, found fault with everything and almost everyone. The only one who
noticeably escaped his ire was Rachel Nesbit, and Janet had to admit that Rachel
handled her work in a way that defied criticism. Curt Newsom came in for some
especially bitter comments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad we can&#8217;t get a horse in here so you&#8217;d feel at home,&#8221;
snapped the director after Curt had bungled one bit of action.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like skunks,&#8221; shot back Curt and turned away.</p>

<p>The director, his face flaming, grabbed Curt&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to explain that,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to?&#8221; asked Curt, looking straight into the face
of the incensed director.</p>

<p>Adolphi dropped his arm and turned away, and in that action he stirred
Janet&#8217;s suspicions anew. If he were without guilt, she felt he would have
forced Curt to a showdown. But he had turned away and Janet thought she caught
just a flicker of Rachel Nesbit&#8217;s eyes. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>Then they
were back at work, rehearsing until well after the usual dinner hour. When the
director finally released them, most of the company was dizzy with
fatigue,</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s trying to wear us out so we won&#8217;t be able to put on a good
show tomorrow night,&#8221; muttered Curt. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a good notion to drop
him down an elevator shaft and see if he&#8217;ll bounce.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim Hill was waiting for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d never come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Adolphi been
pretty tough?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet nodded. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have been much worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a reputation for driving his casts just before the final
show. Sometimes he gets marvelous results; then, again, the thing will fall flat
with everyone all worn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s trying to break us in two,&#8221; grumbled Curt, whose feet
were hurting.</p>

<p>Jim Hill took them down to his office and they ordered sandwiches sent in
while they went over the manuscript. It had been given the approval of the
continuity chief and was to be incorporated into the program.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s good stuff,&#8221; said Janet as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>laid down the
script. &#8220;You&#8217;ve caught the spirit of the picture at last. If this
doesn&#8217;t boom public interest in &#8216;Kings of the Air&#8217; to a high
pitch, I&#8217;ll be a very mistaken young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others agreed with her that Jim had struck the right note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the thing to do is to get Adolphi to swing it through for me
tomorrow night. He can if he wants to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a real question, too,&#8221; said Curt. &#8220;I suspect
he&#8217;s the guy behind all of the trouble and we&#8217;ll find Rachel Nesbit right in
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They left a few minutes later, Jim Hill taking the precious manuscript with
him.</p>

<p>Parting on Sixth Avenue, Jim signalled for a cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not taking any chances tonight,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>They watched him get into the cab and he waved as the taxi shot away and
swung onto a side street. But before it disappeared Janet saw something that
caused a wave of apprehension to sweep over her.</p>

<p>A long, rakish sedan, which had been parked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>further along
the street, leaped ahead, and swung around the corner behind the taxi which was
carrying Jim Hill and the final draft of their radio script. </p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>JANET FINDS A CLUE</p>

<p>Janet&#8217;s sharp cry halted Curt Newsom and Helen. They turned startled faces
toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Someone try to run you down?&#8221; asked
Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Jim,&#8221; replied Janet. &#8220;A car&#8217;s following his taxi.
It started up from the curb and swung right behind his cab. Someone is after
that manuscript. We&#8217;ve got to follow them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curt hailed a cruising taxi and they piled in, the cowboy giving the driver
sharp directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Step on it; we&#8217;ll pay any fines,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The cab lurched away, gaining speed so rapidly they shot around the corner in
a dizzy skid. Turning onto Fifth Avenue they saw the long, dark sedan and ahead
of it the taxi in which Jim was riding. A stop light blazed in their faces and
their cab ground to a halt. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>&#8220;Go on,
go on,&#8221; urged Janet, leaning toward the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t make it,&#8221; he growled, pointing to the heavy stream of
cross traffic which was flowing ahead of them.</p>

<p>When the light changed the taxi and its pursuing sedan had
disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull over to the curb,&#8221; Janet told their driver. &#8220;Now what
shall we do?&#8221; she asked her companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody know where Jim lives?&#8221; asked Curt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s go there and wait for him. We&#8217;ll be sure that he gets
home all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet gave the driver Jim Hill&#8217;s address and they raced up the avenue once
more. In less than fifteen minutes they pulled up before an apartment house and
Janet went into the small lobby and pressed the buzzer that signalled Jim&#8217;s
apartment. There was no reply and she returned to the cab, a mounting fear in
her heart.</p>

<p>She communicated the news to Curt and Helen and they fell silent, waiting and
hoping that Jim would arrive. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>Minutes
ticked away and the taxi driver glanced uneasily at his meter and wondered about
his pay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call the studio and see if he returned there by any
chance,&#8221; said Janet, driven to action in her desperation.</p>

<p>She walked to a nearby drug store and from a pay station there telephoned the
World Broadcasting studio. It was as she had feared; Jim had not returned. In
fact, there was no one in the continuity department.</p>

<p>It was with a heavy heart that Janet returned to the cab. So much depended
upon the safeguarding of the script. There was their own radio début for one
thing. But that was comparatively minor. More than that was the success of the
broadcast which was to arouse public interest in the film which Helen&#8217;s father
had created. This was what really counted.</p>

<p>When she told Helen and Curt that Jim had not returned to the studio, the
cowboy sat silent for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t getting us anywhere,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We may get in
trouble, but it&#8217;s worth a try.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without explaining what he intended to do, he bolted toward the drug store
and returned <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>a
minute later with an address written on a slip of paper. He gave this to their
driver and ordered him to get there with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;To pay a little call on Director Adolphi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think he&#8217;s mixed up in this thing?&#8221; Helen
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it now. There&#8217;s something about him that just
doesn&#8217;t ring true.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was little conversation in the cab during their fast ride to the
director&#8217;s apartment and they all went up together after Curt had paid the
taxi bill.</p>

<p>Insistent ringing of the bell failed to bring an answer and at last they
turned away, their hearts heavy with despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to report this to the nearest police station,&#8221; said
Curt. &#8220;You girls might just as well go back to your hotel. There&#8217;s
nothing further you can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we seem so helpless,&#8221; groaned Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just exactly that,&#8221; growled Curt as he signalled two
cabs, one for the girls and the other for himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll phone you the
minute I get any word of good news.&#8221; </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>Janet and
Helen said little on their way back to the hotel, for a numbing sort of ache had
taken possession of their bodies. After days of fatiguing rehearsals, the
broadcast appeared doomed. Helen cried a little as their cab swung onto Broadway
and the bright lights of the Great White Way blazed in their faces.</p>

<p>At the hotel Janet stopped at the desk to inquire about mail and the clerk
handed her a telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for you,&#8221; she said, handing the message to Helen, who
tore it open with fingers that were none too steady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is awful,&#8221; she groaned. &#8220;Dad and Mother are
coming to New York for the first broadcast. What will I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t answer the telegram tonight,&#8221; Janet warned her.
&#8220;Perhaps something brighter will have taken place by
tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet opened the door of her own room and snapped on the light. As she did so
a small envelope, which had been slipped under the door, drew her attention and
she reached down to pick it up. Helen came in the room just then and looked at
Janet curiously as she opened the envelope. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>Janet&#8217;s
face flushed as she read the message, which had been printed crudely on a sheet
of fine linen paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Helen, alarmed at the expression on Janet&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>Janet handed her the sheet of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to the sticks where you belong or you&#8217;ll get more of what
happened last night. This means both of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the nerve of some people,&#8221; stormed Helen. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
be threatened into leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither will I,&#8221; said Janet firmly, &#8220;but this thing is
getting terribly serious. Last night I was made unconscious by some prowler and
tonight Jim has disappeared with the script of our radio show.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet paused and looked at the sheet of stationery in her hand. Then she
lifted it to her nose and sniffed carefully. Helen looked on in wonderment and
Janet finally handed the sheet to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smell anything?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just a trace of perfume,&#8221; agreed Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever smell that before?&#8221; Janet was insistent. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>&#8220;It
does seem kind of familiar, but I don&#8217;t know where.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it in the studio?&#8221; Janet was pressing hard for an
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone in our company?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen looked frankly alarmed and finally a wave of comprehension swept over
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Rachel Nesbit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s just who I mean. This sheet is scented with the
same perfume Rachel uses. Of course hundreds of others may use it, too, but it
at least gives us a clue. And this printing, disguised though it is, is that of
a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if we can find Rachel, we may be able to solve this
mystery,&#8221; burst out Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can scare her into telling us something,&#8221; agreed Janet.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll phone the studio and get her home address. We&#8217;ll go there at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Curt? He&#8217;ll want to know what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a woman&#8217;s job,&#8221; replied Janet. &#8220;We&#8217;ll let him
try to find Jim. You and I are going alone on this particular mission.&#8221;
</p>

<p style='text-align:center; display:block; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom: 32px;'>OPPORTUNITY AHEAD</p>

<p>They obtained Rachel&#8217;s home address from the studio, slipped on their
coats, and after making sure that they had an ample supply of money in their
purses, hastened down and hailed a cab.</p>

<p>Rachel lived in the Greenwich Village section and their driver swung over to
Fifth Avenue and raced south, green lights winking a clear path ahead of
them.</p>

<p>There was little conversation in the cab as they sped toward the village and
when they drew up in front of the narrow building which housed Rachel&#8217;s
apartment Janet paid the bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to say to her?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>Janet shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;I
suppose I&#8217;ll accuse her of writing this threatening note. That ought to be
enough to get us into her apartment and once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>we&#8217;re there
you look around for anything suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were entering the apartment when a car drew up to the curb and Janet
seized her companion&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of sight, quick. That&#8217;s the sedan which followed Jim&#8217;s
taxi.&#8221;</p>

<p>They slipped into the shadows to the right of the doorway and watched the
sedan. Rachel Nesbit stepped out and after her came John Adolphi, director of
their radio program. Janet could hear Helen&#8217;s gasp for under the director&#8217;s
arm was a familiar portfolio. It was the portfolio in which Jim Hill had carried
the manuscript.</p>

<p>Rachel and the director disappeared into the apartment building and Janet,
without a word to Helen, ran toward the nearest shop, a little fruit store in a
half basement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can I find a policeman?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>The shop keeper helped her phone in an alarm and in less than five minutes a
radio car pulled up in front of the store.</p>

<p>Janet told her story quickly and when the officers looked doubtful, she
pleaded with them. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to believe me. Every minute counts. If that script is destroyed the company may lose thousands of dollars worth of business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she put through several calls and finally reached Mr. McGregor, head of
the continuity department. His words electrified the police and they swept down
the streets and stormed up into the apartment building to the third floor where
Rachel lived. In answer to their sharp knock, Rachel opened the door and they
shouldered their way in.</p>

<p>Janet saw Rachel&#8217;s face blanch as she saw her, but Janet&#8217;s heart leaped
for on a table was the missing manuscript. Director Adolphi was pulled out of a
closet and from his ashen lips tumbled the sordid story. He was really
Rachel&#8217;s brother and the two had conspired to steal the manuscript and ruin
the World Broadcasting Company&#8217;s chances for the contract with the motion
picture company. Another broadcaster had offered him a large sum, he said, and
promised a job if he would steal the script and ruin the program.</p>

<p>They hastened back to the studio where a tense group awaited their coming.
Mr. McGregor <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>was
there and so was Curt. Janet started suddenly when she saw Jim Hill with a
bandage around his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened to you?&#8221; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adolphi ran my cab into a curb and then pulled a gun on me and took
the script away. Of course he had a mask on, but I recognized his voice. He
clouted me over the head when I tried to resist and the next thing I knew Curt
had found me at the police station where I was being given emergency
treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor spoke. &#8220;What about Adolphi and that precious sister of
his?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in police custody awaiting whatever charges may be filed
against them,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor nodded. &#8220;That can be done tomorrow. How about you
girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all right,&#8221; replied Janet and Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little tired, maybe,&#8221; added Helen, by way of an
afterthought.</p>

<p>The continuity chief looked at Jim Hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think you can step in tomorrow and whip this company in to shape so
we&#8217;ll be sure of the contract?&#8221; he asked. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>Jim&#8217;s face
lighted up. &#8220;I know I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then get home and get some sleep. You&#8217;re in charge of the
program.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned back to Janet and Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like New York?&#8221; the question was so sudden that it caught them
unawares.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exciting,&#8221; gasped Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t always like this,&#8221; smiled the continuity chief. He
was looking intently at Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you like to join my staff as a writer?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet could hardly believe her ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I think I&#8217;d like it,&#8221; she managed to say. &#8220;Yes, I
know I would.&#8221; She plunged in blindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if you girls want to stay on, there&#8217;ll be a place for Helen in
the stock company and for you on my writing staff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Think
it over and let me know tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later when they were alone in their rooms, Janet and Helen had their
first chances to talk uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>Helen smiled contentedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a relief to know that the program to boost Dad&#8217;s picture
is going through all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>right,&#8221;
she said. After a pause she went on, &#8220;What shall we do about the jobs in
Radio City?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll accept,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about school back home; what about going to Corn Belt
U.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that, but an opportunity to work in Radio City
doesn&#8217;t come every day. In six months we&#8217;ll have had enough. Then we can go
back and start our university careers at Corn Belt U.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will our folks think?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe they&#8217;ll agree with us that six months here in radio work
can be looked upon as a valuable part of our education.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll tell Mr. McGregor we&#8217;ll stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ll tell him. Now I&#8217;m going to write the
folks and tell them all about it,&#8221; said Janet, picking up a pen and
sitting down to the task of writing of the thrilling adventures which had
befallen them since their arrival in New York.</p>
